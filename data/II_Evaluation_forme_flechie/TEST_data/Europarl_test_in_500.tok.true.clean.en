Mr Watson has the floor for a point of order .
the decision of the Ecofin Council requires the Commission shortly after May 1998 to propose a review of the agrimonetary system .
he must , in turn , try to inject some ambition into this budget . I think , however , that , with such a rigid and narrow budgetary framework , it will be difficult for him to find the resources for the ambitious policy expected by Europeans .
I hope that young Europeans will not have to gag the European Parliament or keep us mute , but that we can courageously defend our values and democracy .
this gives us hope for new impetus to perhaps take us a bit further forward , even if we will need staying power .
they are of no value in cities , however .
this shows the level of intelligence which this man has , in other words , none at all .
there was great scepticism .
what is the timetable for these proposals ?
the historical significance of Budapest 1956 is much more than local or national .
I hope that we can produce practical proposals within the very near future .
nevertheless , the Presidency is convinced that this approach is the most realistic basis for an ultimate agreement , provided everyone has the will to succeed and shows sufficient political will .
the Commission and the Council had meetings with Mr Rogosin , the presidential envoy , and with Minister Rasov .
in this way , the European Union and the European Community will reaffirm their commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and underline the commitment to put in place the necessary measures in the fight against problems of climate change .
this Treaty will create more transparency and more democracy and enhance the EU &apos;s capacity to act , thus enabling it to perform its functions more effectively .
in principle , the vote ought to take place now , but if not it will take place this evening .
on that basis , the Commission will consider whether it is still possible to adhere to the accession date of 1 January 2007 .
but we think that it is vital that the negotiations about to start , which may prove to be difficult and slow , are directed towards certain key areas at Community level .
for example , the idea of setting up networks of experts to exchange best practices and exploit synergies received considerable support during the public consultation .
today &apos;s proposal meets one of the specifications set in Nice , namely to extend the current aid regulation to 30 June .
Madam President , the Seventh Framework Programme for research is the largest research programme in the world : it has a budget of EUR 54.6 billion for the current period 2007-2013 and has funded over 9 000 projects to date .
I flew out from Heathrow this morning .
given the deplorable economic situation ( I can only recall an unemployment rate of 80 % and an inflation rate above 1 700 % ) and increasing levels of repression , public opinion in the country is openly turning against him more and more .
we have not done that with the amendments that we have made .
so let the 450 million vote on the Treaty .
I hope the honourable Member understands the position I am in .
we must therefore use all of that weight to influence the Geneva process and the stabilisation operations in the country .
why would we do this , when what most of these women need most is a stable , loving relationship in their life ?
the controls on internal borders will only be abolished if the EU confirms that the applicant country can fully guarantee effective implementation of the acquis communautaire of the EU in this matter .
I have no faith in this chamber &apos;s way of handling this task , as I had precisely the same job of examining these seven institutions two years ago and then , ladies and gentlemen , discovered the most appalling things going on in the Committee of the Regions .
it is therefore essential to begin considering this issue , in the light of the Commission report on the state of application of the general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas .
we are therefore withdrawing the proposal in Amendment No 10 because we have achieved precisely what we wanted to achieve with this vote .
the drafting of the report is in itself a confirmation of the importance of the topic and the text included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , as it involved the participation of various committees which contributed six opinions .
the second issue concerns emissions offsetting , or trading .
however , I have to consider it necessary for previous sentences to be taken into account , provided that their weight in the other evaluation is equal to the sentence issued by the Member State in which proceedings have been opened .
I voted against this resolution because it does not place enough emphasis on the objective of full employment .
it would be unjust , therefore , to describe the document as unambitious , but it would nevertheless have been justifiable to level this criticism at the document if it had been carried out by a Commission which had been in action for longer .
a totally different approach must be taken .
despite the fact that the economic reality is changing , policy has to remain fixed .
although the first report by Mr Maurice was never presented during the previous legislature , the report before us could have been a step forward but that will not happen .
when is Russia going to stop threatening human rights activists ?
Mr President , you were quite right to point out that it only affects some languages .
it was heartening to us , as Parliament , to have representatives from no less than three DGs of the Commission present at the conciliation and working together .
they want to see action after 2003 , not merely more words .
in addition , there are concerns regarding possible conflicts of interest and lack of transparency .
that applies , for instance , to the amendment on the need first to sort waste and only thereafter dump or incinerate it ; the same applies to the sorting of organic waste .
you have seen what has happened all day with the agenda and it is not satisfactory .
emergency aid that arrives too late tarnishes the Union &apos;s efficient image and undermines the feeling of European solidarity .
I should like to express my strongest possible objection to the operation of that veto in the Security Council , because it effectively vetoes , not only the mandate by the United Nations in relation to Sfor , but also the foreign policy of Ireland and other countries which operate in Sfor based on the UN mandate .
now the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment is urging that we maintain the 1977 definition . I do not consider that acceptable .
so this area must be promoted on the basis of a few , very few , but solid and identifiable European political projects which deal with the real problems facing us , the first of which is Islamist terrorism .
that is why I believe this to be so important .
if we wish to reduce food contamination and pollution of the external environment , we must favour manufacturers who have that approach .
( PL ) Madam President , we are dealing with a scandal , but calling it a scandal is putting it too mildly .
this is a restriction which , according to the European Fisheries Council , is required in order to protect cod , whilst biologists claim that such recommendations were never made and that this was a political decision .
however , in spite of these doubts , the scheme is worth supporting and the European Conservatives and Reformists will certainly endorse it .
this report deserves credit for demanding accountability from Member States .
that would send a message from the world community to the warring parties as a way out of this appalling situation .
I agree to the proposal , but cannot refrain from making one small remark in conclusion , namely that life for Parliament would surely be even better and even more democratic if there were less or no comitology .
as presidency we are acutely conscious that we are almost at the half-way point with regard to the 2010 deadline by which the targets set in 2000 must be reached .
in fact , on the basis of a civilian use of nuclear energy , this appears to have no other use apart from replacing the normal hygiene and safety rules that processed foods should already follow .
Secondly , however , it is also my belief that a GDA system , as has also been proposed , is very likely to provide the information that knowledge-seeking consumers will find useful for making the right choices .
but what we want to see is this improvement , and part of what this is about is providing training .
our promise on the CAP should not be in any way reneged on until 2013 , as we said in Berlin .
I said at the time that nothing prepared me for what I found when we were there .
it can help in restoring peace and consolidating democratic hopes in the region , but it can do so only if it takes into account the extreme complexity of the region , and makes this a central element of its strategy .
in the meantime , can she give us an assurance that the single farm payments that are going to come about as a result of decoupling , and which we know will have an environmental element , will have a strong tree-planting element as well ?
however , the latter also means that apart from jointly refining the legislation providing a stable basis for safety , it is also necessary to ensure the effective operation of the national authorities that constitute this framework , so that every citizen in the European Union can enjoy the greater safety offered by the new directive .
the Stability and Growth Pact does make it possible to recover the room for manoeuvre which did not exist , and to avoid the monetary policy from becoming overburdened , which would lead to an obviously overly restrictive policy mix .
Sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals ( debate )
I must emphasize that that is explicitly acknowledged by the two parties - the European Union and the United States - in the new agreement that we have concluded .
the advantages of it for recreation purposes are well documented .
I received a letter at just 12 o &apos;clock today from the Oral Questions Services which said : &apos; your question is one of the first questions to the Commission .
ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , following a half-hour analysis of the Lisbon strategy , there is no need to emphasise that it is essential to strengthen research and innovation in the European Union .
. I readily acknowledge the importance of drawing the Council ’ s attention to the treatment of minorities in the regions that you have just mentioned , and of making a kind of comparison with the protection of minorities , in accordance with the Ohrid Agreement .
on Mr Mulder &apos;s comment : you noted that , because the budget at second reading was below the margin in agricultural policy , the risk of a change in exchange rates needed to be included in the calculation , because it would be not unwelcome if the euro were to rise against the dollar .
Commissioner , it is up to you now to ensure that it is implemented and to bring forward the subsequent provisions on prevention with your target of 2014 .
this is part of a pledge made by the Commission at the conference in Brussels in April this year .
as we have repeatedly emphasized , this is a requirement which simultaneously renders service to workers and to citizens of the most backward countries , by ensuring that they are not exploited and that their quality of life does not deteriorate .
we have prepared , and we will shortly be submitting , the new draft proposal on the Security of Gas Supply Directive ; an impact assessment is being made and in the coming weeks it will be here in Parliament .
unfortunately I cannot hold out the same degree of hope for the chairman of the fund and the secretariat .
in the beginning you could say : you have to ban antipersonnel mines .
we are facing an horrendous crisis that neither this Parliament nor the European Union can ignore .
she had to work 12 hours a day , seven days a week .
it is even used in the steel industry too .
although open and frank dialogue between partners ought to be the most obvious thing in the world , it is rather remarkable that the Ukrainian presidential elections scheduled for the coming weekend have shown themselves to be – to put it mildly – deserving of criticism to a significant degree .
within this framework , the strategic guidelines which we are discussing today are important , because they refer precisely to the content of cohesion policy : where the money will be directed and which the priority sectors will be .
for example , from the built environment .
the Commission has come forward with proposals to enhance parliamentary scrutiny and offers other compromise solutions , but these have failed to gain traction both in Parliament and in the Council .
I believe that we are right to examine these measures because , when we observe the manner in which the debate has unfolded , there is clearly , following the European Parliament ’ s adoption of the measures , a legal ‘ creativity ’ that requires us to be vigilant .
I applaud this declaration , like Prime Minister Sharon , who stated that this is the first time such a demand in the fight against terrorism has been addressed in such a clear and unambiguous fashion to Arafat by the Union .
you cannot have more European security for less money .
in the mean time we must lose no time in increasing the share of European electricity supplied by nuclear energy .
so how can we address this ?
the lack of a legislative basis which would make this sector more operative and remove it from the field of unanimous decision-making within the Council will give impetus to this sector , which is in the hands of the large tour operators and completely outside the control of this House .
the second task is that you should be saying to all your colleagues that their business information services ( because they have services that reach out to SMEs ) should also be circulating that information to them in their own languages and you should be putting just a modest amount of your budget behind to actually explain to businesses what is going on .
I voted in favour of accepting the report on the Parliament and Council Directive concerning information disclosure and translation requirements , intended to reduce excessive administrative burden imposed on certain types of companies .
the fact remains that even our exports to the OECD countries have fallen since 1985 .
I am looking forward to holding discussions with you in the future on the wine reform that I will present to the Council , hopefully just before the summer break , and then I will be happy to come here to the European Parliament to present it at the same time , as the basis for our future discussions .
I am also delighted , today , to welcome a delegation from the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) . this delegation comprises 15 members of its ad hoc committee on direct elections and additional powers .
as you informed us , with these agreements , citizens of these six countries and , reciprocally , EU citizens , will , in future , be exempted from the short-stay visa requirement - at least some of them will be , since excluded from this exemption are those who wish to work or to perform a paid activity , as an employee or as a service provider , in short .
the Better Regulation package that the Commission adopted last week sets out a number of fundamental principles that will be followed in future policy and legislative proposals .
for a successful human rights policy it is essential for the EU Member States to implement a joint , consistent and visible policy in bilateral relations with countries that do not respect human rights .
I would propose to say no to Amendment No 17 .
let me state quite categorically that the name of this new body , which we are going to set up some day or other , is not the main issue for me .
however , consultation also involves exchange .
Yes , the observation of the planet must be assured in the long term so as to study its slow , dynamic variations and , in particular , those caused by the actions of man that affect the global climate , natural resources and biodiversity .
Romania is still a long way from this .
I am thinking in particular of Romania and of Bulgaria and of others too , but I shall also add the Balkans .
there is no doubt that the peace process will progress more correctly and completely if the European Union becomes politically involved .
if we have clear goals for the environment and health and we can mobilise society , NGOs and politicians - not forgetting good lawyers - then we can reach our goals , step by step .
it was external pressure , via your decision , Mr President , to block a couple of hundred budget lines which finally made the Council aware that it could no longer delay this issue .
with this result there is reason to wonder what the point of all the work on cohesion policy is .
that is why it is very important to pay close attention to innovation .
for instance , why , outside this House at any rate , is there continual reference to carbon emissions ?
it falls within the EU &apos;s overall imperialist strategy worldwide .
as our task is to be impartial and we need to produce legislation that is comprehensible to European citizens , perhaps further thought is necessary over the next few months .
they must be able to expect direct benefit from the clinical trial .
these so-called asylum seekers , whom I prefer to call freeloaders , must be received in the region .
to be even more explicit , in order to have adequate security we do not just need safeguards for people ’ s fundamental rights , but also actual development of the European area of justice .
he said that he not only wanted cross-border zones but large areas of north-west Russia to be covered .
– Mr President , Commissioner , if we in Europe want to protect ourselves , we should have acted years ago to provide aid to Asia , and by that I mean technical aid to address the problem that much of our meat is already produced there from animals kept in breeding establishments .
I sincerely hope that the perpetrators of this heinous crime will be found and brought to justice .
but the report acknowledges the need for an independent , scientific , objective and rigorous study of the US conventions on drugs , to update and complete them .
so at this stage of the procedure the Commission cannot accept amendments with regard to funding since the budgetary provision has to form part of the framework programme .
when I drafted my report in July , I saw at once that that this original proposal was lacking .
the general spirit of the report , and the motion for a resolution presented , is quite critical .
to be entitled to access information on environmental issues is not only a right but also an issue of power .
it is necessary , therefore , for the Bosnian authorities to focus on the teaching of peace .
we agree with the proposal that the Commission once and for all adopt recasting as a standard legislative technique so that , for each initiative , the text can be available in its entirety , also where there are specific amendments , providing a clear indication of the new parts and those which are unchanged , thereby increasing the legibility and transparency of Community legislation .
a platform for reporting offences detected online must be put in place to centralise cyber-offences so that they can be collated by Europol .
I hope that is not true and that those Members who return to the new Parliament will again have the pleasure of working with him .
therefore these conventions need to be ratified and implemented across the globe so that all suppliers can adhere to them .
Primarily that means , for instance , the consolidation of state finances .
area of Freedom , Security and Justice ( AFSJ ) 2007 ( vote )
we have three years in which to do it and I believe that this is a task for each and every one of us .
on the contrary , they protect them , making justice more efficient and putting judicial cooperation in the hands of judges , and not of governments , within the European Union .
they paid with their lives for the insane irresponsibility of those who argue in favour of a murderer &apos;s right to life .
Applauding Bulgaria ’ s efforts is at variance with the EU ’ s much-trumpeted aims .
it is also important to point out that , unlike the Berès report , these proposals make no positive suggestions that would actually allow us to have genuine economic governance in the European Union .
thank you , Commissioner Bangemann .
as regards the latter , I question the deep-rooted nature of certain groups &apos; refusal , especially since this committee clearly has the role of informing and creating initiatives and not of controlling .
I welcome the opportunity to have this debate .
in Category 3 , you have proposed an increase for the trans-European networks which actually goes beyond the outcome achieved between Parliament and the Council in the Conciliation Committee .
there is a serious danger that such a drastic reduction in the duration of the sunset clause would send a wrong and dangerous signal to the marketplace that the adoption of the necessary implementing measures could become highly uncertain .
that is why I have studied the events which prompted criticism and unease on the part of Members of Parliament over the question of better regulation .
for the building sector the directives are proving disastrous .
finally , may I too congratulate Mr Markov and wish everyone a Merry Christmas and an Innovative New Year .
this should continue to be the case .
I wish the US would devote as much energy – by which I do not mean military manpower – to solving the actual Middle East problem as it is doing to Iraq .
we should support the public services in those states and at least educate the children .
I would therefore say that this Treaty will help Europe &apos;s legislation to become more social , based on the aims you have agreed with the social partners at this summit .
enough is enough !
it seems to me that to date only a few objectives have been achieved .
if you tell governments that they must make savings and reduce debt when better times arrive , I do not believe that they will suddenly do so merely because the Commission tells them to , but because they want to make good on their election promises when the income situation improves .
apart from having the Presidency , it is a particularly important case for Austria .
( FI ) Madam President , Commissioner , I understand very well that sugar quotas need to be cut further and I am in favour of it .
- Report : Meijer
Preparations are under way in all three areas .
waste storage facilities are leaking , and radiation levels are high .
concerning fisheries agreements , following the new estimations , the Commission can now endorse two changes to the preliminary draft budget if the budget authority can agree on them .
I think that he has emphasized all of the relevant points in this report and in the attached resolution .
by means of forceful pressure from its largest trade partner , the EU , Libya really should be made to pay attention to what respect for human rights and freedoms means and what these entail .
this immediately brings me to my last point .
. ( FR ) I voted against the compromise resolution on Iraq because it goes back on the position taken up by Parliament on 30 January last .
however , there is still the issue of restricted access to the European labour market , affecting over 100 million European citizens .
but how can we really achieve this when we continue to have the common agricultural policy ?
the aim of the proposal before us is to codify Council Directive 95 / 70 / EC of 22 December 1995 , establishing minimum Community measures for controlling diseases affecting bivalve molluscs .
believe me , Mr President , I am really keen to play ball with the Council that you are chairing .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Tsatsos not only on producing such a thorough report , but also for being so receptive to the arguments and amendments put forward by his colleagues in the committee .
as you all now know , that is what we got .
Discussion of political options is a fundamental right , but nowadays it is in practice extremely difficult to exercise that right .
the worst we could do was slightly to delay your lunch by making speeches of one minute , but even this is intolerable to you !
a year ago we discussed the Pradier report on harmful and illegal content on the Internet .
I hope that the presidency will ensure that the initiatives necessary to identify criminal assets are put in place and in good time to avail of the opportunity .
on the other hand , we should not be indifferent to certain values .
I voted in favour of the Bortone report on the proposal for a regulation on nutrition and health claims made on food .
the lessons of this resignation are as follows :
this is particularly the case for inflation .
that being so , the Commission undertakes to include those issues in the work that will be done in implementing this programme .
in March 2006 we compared the roaming prices to their level of autumn 2005 .
in actual fact , the latest meetings of the IGC have shown that a certain number of national delegations are starting to ask themselves some legitimate questions .
I say this with all the respect I have for a country that has voted &apos; no &apos; .
while congratulating the rapporteur , I should also like to ask – if this card is to become a reality – that the Commission and all MEPs stress to Member State governments that they must not see this merely as a technical step forward .
in writing . - ( HU ) I would like to congratulate my colleague Christa Klaß on her report , which highlights the difficulties that women living in rural areas have to face in the labour market and in other aspects of their lives .
I shall now put the request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to a vote .
I should like you to confirm once again , whether solemnly or otherwise , before this House , that we shall therefore not be kept on the sidelines , or too little involved or poorly informed , concerning the commencement and the progress of negotiations on agreements since your declaration .
the new negotiation round to develop the liberalisation of world trade and rules of the game must treat matters on a broad basis so that we can strengthen sustainable economic growth ; reinforce , develop and renew a trading system based on global rules ; and ensure that its benefits are shared out equitably .
as Europeans , we cannot now remain indifferent to what is happening in Equatorial Guinea and to the human rights violations there .
we must also look at the effect of the proposal on small and medium-sized enterprises .
in the future , the need will become greater because women , who have previously assumed responsibility for providing a large part of that care , have now entered the labour market and will continue to do so to an ever-greater degree .
Madam President , at a time when migration flow management and the fight against illegal immigration are becoming ever more complex , it is very difficult for us to accept this Spanish initiative in either substance or form .
as Portuguese Prime Minister Mr Socrates said , with this result Portugal has taken a further firm step forward in building a more open , more tolerant and fairer society .
this is the spirit in which we have supported this proposal , in the hope that it would make our fellow citizens &apos; lives easier through the use of electronic money , but that this would not result in excesses , particularly in terms of supervision mechanisms .
I think that Parliament should be properly informed and taken into account and that Parliament needs to be more involved in the crucial area of justice and internal affairs .
that being said , the big battle will clearly centre upon regional policy .
the EU must show understanding of the situation .
we helped the democrats and we helped everyone who wanted to move towards the European Union .
Speaking as one who is personally involved in the peace process negotiations , I welcome the efforts which have and are at this time being made by Parliament to ensure that the political impetus for this programme is maintained .
all this is included in the new penal code .
you are proposing to give Brussels powers to manage and define minimum social protection , flexible work , which means exploiting the worker , imposing cuts on working hours , which freezes wages and handicaps enterprises , and an absolute stranglehold on social dialogue , like Aubry in France .
terrorism must simply be fought at its political , economic and social roots and the issue of security must not be used as a pretext for not continuing the peace process .
it is a problem of reality .
the general conclusion from this whole affair , Commissioner , is that there will have to be a structural change in the internal organisation of the Commission , a thing which all these phenomena show to be more necessary than might appear at first sight .
&apos;Has to decided to enter EUR 500 000 against item 2727 , Organisation and reception of groups of visitors , Euroscola programme and invitations to opinion multipliers from third countries . &apos;
( the President cut off the speaker )
these are shortcomings that must be reviewed as a matter of priority .
as for harm reduction , I have no objections per se - although I would like to see some of the references to it removed from the report .
we must put more pressure on those who promised their support to deliver that support , and we must put pressure on the Clinton-led reconstruction , and the United Nations , to move faster .
this is the key political question to which we must respond and which the Council must soon answer .
I join with other speakers in their positive response to the important work produced by the committee , chaired by Mr Jarzembowski , and to the excellent work of the rapporteur , Mr Sterckx .
the solution for the future is a massive investment in , and development of , renewable energy .
it is a tribute to my colleagues who have worked with the Italian presidency and with the Commission that we have managed to get an agreement .
has this test been met ?
we cannot only draw attention , rightly , to Guantánamo , Abu Ghraib , the infringements in Colombia and in China , and then ignore the infringements that are occurring in our own countries .
but we in this Parliament will not cease to support a peaceful solution to a question that can only be resolved by peaceful , political means .
as far as expenditure is concerned , I would like to stress that solidarity must continue to be one of the main guidelines for the Union &apos;s actions .
sometimes the need to establish minimum principles is referred to , while at other times the possibility of making a single recommendation to the Member States is mentioned .
I welcome the fact that the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council is to give them close consideration , and - I am finishing now , Mr President - that the forthcoming European Council on 14 February is to give its opinion on these serious events , just as , for example , President Sarkozy very courageously did .
it must enable the regions , diverse as they are , to complete their transformation and to prepare for the future in the best conditions and , in that way , to achieve an optimum level of development .
so the no-fly zones are vital in avoiding humanitarian disaster .
we hope that we will be able to report better news on this for 2010 .
is the idea of a more permanent structure in Iraq and for the region viable ?
in recent days there has been considerable controversy on this matter , not least sparked by remarks published in the newspaper le Monde .
Rising prices of commodities , energy and food further multiply the risk for the most vulnerable groups .
the debate is closed .
we all feel that bypassing the UN and excluding Russia were mistakes and that we urgently need to bring them both back into play .
( PL ) Mr President , I should like to draw particular attention to the title of Mrs Wortmann-Kool &apos;s report .
the free movement of people though is regulated , limited or banned according to their national and , above all , social background .
I must nevertheless emphasise that no instances of fraud or misappropriation have been detected .
the supposed principles of the EU and the famous are being used in keeping with the interests of the imperialist countries .
I support the Council ’ s position and the ECB President , Mr Trichet , in the comments he has made .
having mentioned condoms , it must be said that this is one of the best and safest ways of preventing the spread of the epidemic .
current events require the uptake of serious and real positions at Member State level , particularly those states in the euro area .
the Commission has proposed 1 PPM , in other words , ten times more .
issues such as the Palestinians &apos; right to return , the division of Jerusalem and the Holy Mount , the problem of the settlement policy and Palestinian statehood and the Israeli people &apos; s justifiable demand for security must be discussed directly by the parties to the conflict .
Secondly , the agreements between the Member States – regarding the types of care , and the range and level of services that will be available to people – will also help to clarify the situation for many people .
it is always controversial when you are asked to give yourselves resources .
I do not need to remind you of all the terrorist attacks that have taken place on European soil throughout the last decade .
if no constructive solution can be found to that crisis , and preferably a non-violent solution , I believe that our debate on globalisation and the attempts to find constructive solutions to a series of constituent problems will be damaged for a long time to come .
Europe is of one mind when it comes to conditions for a single system for recruiting top people .
this decision is to be applied for a period of ten years .
first of all , growth .
this development cannot be halted by legislative lacunae .
the first of these is the ever-increasing level of activity in the Member States in terms of uncovering irregularities and abuses relating to European Union funding , although there are unfortunately countries among the old Member States which pass on information regarding abuses to the Commission several years late .
the updated regulations must be managed efficiently right from the start .
one of the reasons for the deterioration in Parliament / Commission relations without doubt has been the arrogant attitude sometimes displayed by certain Commissioners .
then , for example , there is an amendment along the following lines : consumers are entitled to know whether a product is made of animal-derived materials , and they need look no further : the manufacturer must indicate whether the product incorporates any animal products .
we nevertheless chose to abstain in the final vote because we do not believe that it is a good idea for Europe to introduce a financial transaction tax independently if other countries do not also do the same .
the Socrates programme , which covers education in general , has done very well : 500 000 students , 30 000 language teachers and the many other young people who have taken advantage of the programme paint a very positive picture , and in view of this excellent result it seems only logical to continue to provide funding .
as such , it is essential to continue offering them conditions to be able to develop and become secure in the market , by guaranteeing them access to finance and to the potential benefits of the Single Market .
the last thing they need is for that perpetual disaster – the EU – to turn up and make things worse !
EU-level coordination will be vital in this respect and may help eliminate the adverse effects .
once again , Parliament has demonstrated flexibility in the negotiations , without relinquishing its political priorities .
it is absurd that a poor country should get itself into a situation of paying back money to Brussels , but equally absurd that the case should have taken so long .
finally , could I make the observation that far from being the Commission &apos;s work programme for 2001 , we might rename it the work programme of the Commission , Parliament and Council .
if you do not learn from your mistakes , you are doomed to repeat them .
this is not a time for blaming some people because they produce it and others because they consume it .
Needless to say , there is still a difficult issue to be addressed there .
Mr Michel , you have the floor again .
the debate is closed .
but may I take this opportunity to point out in all modesty that the European Parliament has cultivated very close relations with Latin American parliamentarians for years now ; in fact , the longest-standing relations between the European Parliament and other parliaments are with Latin America and date back to the early 1970s .
civil society is in dire circumstances there .
in order to get to grips with this problem and improve coordination , my own Directorate-General &apos; s civil protection division , together with the competent divisions in the areas of industry , health and consumer protection , set up a working party last October including representatives of different branches of the emergency services .
quite frankly , the damaging fiddling with the ECU 300 million can only produce an embarrassed smile , since who could possibly understand the petty wrangling over the socalled revision of the financial perspective , or believe in good faith that the ECU 100 m for the trans-European networks is a job-creation initiative in itself ?
– Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Fava and the Council of Europe rapporteur , Mr Dick Marty .
such neighbourliness can be built on , and I believe that a privileged partnership constitutes a third way between members and non-members of the European Union and those who have a privileged relationship with the European Union and must also have a space for the future .
they will also learn that , despite our differences , there are many , many things that bring us together , and they will also learn something more important : that it is easier for Europe to have big ambitions than small ones .
I think this was mainly so in the Council , where there seemed to be an exaggerated fear of competition but also that the measure might succeed .
it has to be said , however , that the decision by the Ecofin earlier this month does not constitute a death blow for TENs .
you will receive the report with our analysis before the end of this year .
it certainly is not the best time to do so .
that is certainly what most people in my country and the rest of Europe want , according to opinion polls .
it is my desire and trust that this strange , idiosyncratic British policy will prove to be as short-lived as possible .
( the sitting was closed at 5.53 p.m. )
yet monetary union begins in only 17 days .
it omits to note that the euro , if it is brought in , will be a new and powerful factor of division between the Member States of the wider Europe .

we are debating the possibility of revitalising Europe as a leading figure that can promote a project of democracy and stability at a time when the world has seen a prevalence of insane political decisions based on hatred , fear and the presumption of exporting democracy with bombs .
this is what will happen , although the Council has borrowed a good idea from the world of business , the scoreboard , the actual term being a perfectly balanced scorecard .
Lastly , although I am in favour of some tax incentives , there is a considerable risk of finding ourselves hemmed in by tightening budgets .
you should also remember that rejection would stand in the way of many European undertakings and go against our common Lisbon objectives of increasing Europe ’ s competitiveness .
Consequently , I would like to remind both the Commission and the Council that the political will exists to evolve all the instruments needed to ensure that the euro is supported not only by the pillar of monetary union , but also by the pillar of economic union .
we are not acting in this way out of any particular affection for the people of Georgia .

in addition , the majority of the remaining vessels will be ones that , because they are under 10 years old , are not eligible for decommissioning subsidy .
the common position is already a compromise and takes account of first reading amendments by adding in measures on existing plants which were not part of the Commission proposal .
that Georgia has threatened to resort to violence is also unacceptable .
this tiny percentage represents a loss of 1 700 million euros .
why is the Council not prepared to introduce one ?
they deserve to see their opportunities for innovation and competitive prospects discussed every year .
Meanwhile , a number of decisions taken in the European Union have led to greater recognition of the importance of integration and the concept of sustainability .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , I should also like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Ferreira , on her excellent work and on her close cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs on this important issue .
as for the speeches we have heard , I would like to begin with Mrs Green &apos;s , in which she referred to the Presidency of the Council and I would like to point out the importance of some of the chapters which Mrs Green mentioned , in particular the fight against discrimination .
here of course this is really a question of politics , and not a matter of mere experts .
Mr President , Mr Collins , the Commission is heavily involved in improving access for European schools to new information technologies .

I hope now that the redistribution of available resources aimed at optimising their allocation is carried through to the end , in order to counter the effects of the international crisis that we are all experiencing in our daily lives .
this was a triumph for communication and if we continue in this way , we will bring Europe closer to the people .
Protectionism is an evil short-sighted instrument with which to defend workers ’ rights .
EU exporters of consumer goods , electronics , pharmaceuticals , chemicals and medical devices are just some of the sectors which will benefit immensely from the removal of non-tariff barriers .
the second question is really more broadly addressed to Parliament : are we going to set up a permanent standing liaison committee of MEPs involved with development and cooperation to report to the General Assembly of the United Nations each year on our joint cooperation ?
I hope to be able to work with you over the next five years .
the scientific effort must therefore be increased and relate both to the biology of marine environments and to the selection of fishing gear , as well as to the socio-economic consequences of the measures for managing the resource .
Mr Donner has the floor .
Mr Ibrahim worked with Commission funds and has been accused of fraud , even though the Commission usually carries strict controls .
I welcome the clear position you have taken in your report on these issues .
the first is obviously taking on board the conclusions of the de Larosière report and the need to ensure that equality and harmonious conditions exist among the various colleges of supervisors , and , to this end , the need to strengthen the European authority responsible for monitoring insurance companies .
this is a very crude form of censorship , there is no justification for it and I should like to know what part you played in banning this exhibition .
first , the energy sector should be under state control , and there should be reliable back-up facilities at every power plant , positioned sufficiently far away .
why ?
experience proves the good cost-effective relationship and the crucial role played by port state measures , in conjunction with other instruments , in the fight against IUU fishing .
we are also agreed that monetary policy should be designed and implemented by a European Central Bank which is independent .
the European Parliament recently adopted a resolution , which shows the determination of representatives of European citizens to conduct a fierce and effective battle against terrorism .

( the oral amendment was accepted . )
as Mr Tsatsos pointed out , tobacco kills .
it has been said , and rightly , that industrial policy must be put back on the agenda for the European institutions .
that is not right .
but we ought to recognize that we in the European Union are a community in which Spain borders onto the Czech Republic , and in which Bavaria also borders on Andorra .
worse still , why is it that in the Dutch request fixed-term contract workers were left out of any support , when they are the hardest hit ?
so I expect that the agreement will also help us extend and deepen cooperation in this area .
this is how the Maastricht Treaty and the Nice Treaty were achieved , and now the EU is following the same tactic and forcing Ireland to vote again on the Lisbon Treaty when it has already rejected it , as did France and the Netherlands .
Spain could be an advocate for the former colony that it abandoned , as Portugal was for self-determination in East Timor , but it is not , as it does not wish to compromise its commercial and other interests in Morocco .
without the export subsidies some of the surpluses would remain on the EU internal market , which would lead to a further price decrease .
it should be possible for the requirement concerning emergency telephones along European motorways to be modified in accordance with the extremely low traffic density which exists in northern Scandinavia , in order to avoid unreasonable costs being incurred .
we therefore believe - and I direct this point in particular to the Commissioner - that the justice and home affairs sector must be allocated the manpower and administrative resources required to carry out the mountain of tasks before it , in an efficient manner and within the agreed time scales .
one of the most important matters we have begun to deal with is of course water , in Europe and at global level .

this report must include a specific chapter containing Parliament ’ s views on social protection issues .
we already have problems in Europe when it comes to security of supply , consumer rights and environmental concerns , and we have to do something about the greenhouse effect .

the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has given profound thought to this .
thank you , Mr Monti .
are you invoking Rule 100 on interpretation of the Rules of Procedure ?
while compromise is welcomed in many other areas discussed in Parliament , Turkish membership and EU-Turkey relations are not among them .
we are concluding the parliamentary term in the midst of an economic crisis that has made us realise that we have a systemic crisis on our hands , and the new Parliament must therefore also be a driving force that will help society to rediscover values that are nowadays too often neglected .
the hopes of many patients suffering from rare diseases rely on our obtaining a regulation on orphan drugs in Europe too as soon as possible .
the report also contains an issue that has reared its head yet again and led us to vote against .
in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development we struck a very , very good balance with our compromises .
we often talked about it here , in October and November .

these qualifications , which are awarded by each Member States , according to its own procedures and systems , come under the sovereignty of each Member State and the EQF respects this .
the Member States should hang their heads in shame for the fact that the supervision of compliance with legislation is so deficient .
it also recalls the resolution of two years ago , in which Parliament called on the EU Member States to recognise the Tibetan government-in-exile within three years in the event of the Tibetan situation stagnating or getting worse .

approval and the payments of credits must go together with the fulfilment of conditions such as compatibility of the project with the Fund &apos;s declared principles , its suitability and utility for development , its connection with the promotion of the project and its proper and transparent management .

we are now therefore asking you for it again , Commissioner , and I believe it is reasonable to ask that it be carried out in that manner .
happy as I am that an SME facility has been set up for Euro-Wirral , is such spending instigated , delivered and monitored by DG XVI or DG XXIII ?
some of the amendments , for example the references to the provisional nature of what we are doing , are of no real legal value .
I have nothing against rights – quite the contrary – but why was the European Union as such not allowed to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights ?
some done , but a lot more to do .
( RO ) I wish to congratulate Pál Schmitt on two counts : on his new post and for his well-structured , comprehensive report , which will definitely enhance the effectiveness of relations between the business and academic worlds in Europe .
the second point I should like to emphasise has always been a favourite in these debates : the coexistence or even duplication of a petition and complaint , possibly giving rise to a contravention procedure .
the proposal also has elements of overkill , and the timetable set has obvious risks .
I will therefore limit myself to two very brief points .
attention is drawn to the fact that the World Bank must attach greater importance to the threat of biofuels to food supply .
what this means is that the states cannot take it for granted that they will keep getting money when disasters strike , and then , for years on end , carry on with planning and population policies that have failed utterly .
the next item is the report ( A4-0323 / 97 ) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing an action programme to improve awareness of Community law for the legal professions - Robert Schuman Project ( COM ( 96 ) 0580 - C4-0606 / 96-96 / 0277 ( COD ) ) .

( the House rose and observed a minute &apos; s silence )
trust of this kind , which is not always in evidence , has been shown to be vital to the success of this mission .
due pressure needs to be exerted on Israel .
this is an inadequate structure in a Community of over 25 Member States .
Mr President , as the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats ’ coordinator on our parliamentary steering group for the Lisbon strategy , I should like to start by expressing a degree of satisfaction .
that is the only choice we have .
this is even more regrettable as the elections were held in an improved atmosphere in which the freedoms of assembly and expression were at least broadly respected .
( de ) Madam President , there is not much point in playing Realpolitik and Moralpolitik off against each other , as Mr Watson has said .
as long as all this does not affect the Commission , it does not matter .
Parliament plays a key role in enlargement policy .
but we must also consider that the European Union spends significant amounts of money - ECU 250 million per year - on a programme of aid to the Philippines , a programme for the most part designed to ensure stability through economic development in certain sensitive areas .

I welcome the fact that reference is made to an ambitious vision for the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) .
Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the European Parliament , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , and more particularly Mr Markov , for the attention that they have given to the EBRD .
this is not Article 138 , because we are not in the field of social policy , but Article 308 , making it a different initiative based on unanimity of the Member States .

on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( CS ) Madam President , Mr Potočnik , ladies and gentlemen , the differences between the poor and the rich regions of the Community are truly enormous .

Mr President , you certainly have to hand it to the United States these days .

the enlargement of the Union by another two countries , the ongoing process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty and , most of all , the start of implementation of the new financial perspective must be supported by effective implementation of European Union policies in such a way as to meet global challenges and the expectations of our citizens .

I look forward to further constructive cooperation which can ensure that the Community continues to play a leading role in the protection of the ozone layer .
such a gas pipeline route would also make a sound contribution to the settlement of security problems of the European Union and the Baltic region in particular .
the Council is also to blame , firstly for not being here to listen to the debate , but also for not taking decisions , because it is swayed more by purely national interests than by a European vision of agriculture .
( de ) Madam President , the problems with the rule of law in Russia are not random aberrations but a cancer , spreading systematically .
the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has taken a very clear stance on this .
