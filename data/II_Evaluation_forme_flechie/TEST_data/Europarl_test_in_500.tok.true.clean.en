Europe now needs to have a comprehensive directive on preventing and combating all forms of violence against women .
Alzheimer ’ s and related diseases affect millions of European citizens who , in time , become incapable of coping with their lives , not to mention their families who , when they assume responsibility for the care of such patients , have to reduce considerably or even give up their professional activities .
we do not want a US-style situation in which legislation is made according to the misconceptions of the day .
it is quite clear that where economic interests and massive promotion combine with subsidies , outrages are almost compulsory .
therefore , the Commission regrets that it cannot support these amendments .
. I voted for the joint resolution on the issue of extraordinary rendition .
nor would it be tolerable in the case of many small businesses if uniform , across-the-board reductions in working time were steamrollered through from Dresden to Porto .
Absurd though it might sound , I was wholeheartedly on Mrs Theato &apos;s side , and said that it really should be worked out with absolute clarity and utterly unambiguously , and that the third variant was to be left open .
Mr President , in his original draft report , our rapporteur , Mr Napolitano , quite rightly described the dual challenge of taking account of the citizens &apos; attachment to their regional and local roots and , in moving from fifteen to twenty-five Member States , avoiding any weakening of the institutions &apos; operation .
the objectives are as follows .
this Committee should present its report to the European Council under the French Presidency .
all in all , international trade agreements are crucial for us .
we have seen leaks purporting to be official documents .
the High Commissioner , Mr Ruud Lubbers , used the word &apos; unacceptable &apos; and I would add politically sordid .
as far as the last amendment is concerned , I would like to say that we completely agree that there should be a follow-up in relation to participation in these programmes .
it now has the means to assume its environmental responsibilities without , however , sacrificing its economy .
a further problem is the service charge involved in outsourcing .
subsidiarity , proportionality , better quality legislation , simple regulation , increased codification : all must become major political issues on which we will focus .
this focus is not helped by the Commission &apos;s concentration on the idea of employment security as opposed to job security , which is repeated in both the Green Paper on labour law and the communication on flexicurity .
I should also like to thank the Commission for their preliminary work , even if the communication on worker information and consultation is not exactly a success story , but that is not the Commission &apos;s fault .
2007 will be a crucial year for the future of the European Union .
I have spoken about legislation .
this one-language solution would cut costs , providing encouragement , above all , to small and medium-sized enterprises to use the European patent since their economic dimensions means they often cannot bear high translation costs .
in the economic sphere two things need to happen : steps to suspend the Association Agreement need to be initiated on the basis of breaches of human rights obligations contained in the Association Agreement ; and legal steps should be initiated to recover duties due because Israel has misrepresented the origin of its exports .
Mr President , I would request on behalf of the Group of the European Peoples ’ Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists that , given the time , the vote be postponed until the next part-session in Strasbourg .
Mr Tillich &apos;s proposal to readjust the budget by a proportionate redistribution of the last three years so that we actually return to the original preliminary draft by the Commission is very welcome .
until now , there were no particular administrative difficulties when travelling from Russia to Kaliningrad or vice versa .
Learning the appropriate lessons from this and building a genuinely open and democratic Europe remains one of our challenges for the future .
Mr President , let the experiences from the taxation package serve as an example .
Mr President , I refer to Rule 142 in conjunction with Rules 132 and 137 of the Rules of Procedure .
three problems have become clear , however , and I should like to hear Commissioner Solbes Mira &apos; s position on them .
but we will continue to help all citizens who come to us for the wrong reason by using the Network of Ombudsmen of the European Union as a mechanism of transferring complaints to them , thereby helping those citizens and in a sense trying to apply subsidiarity in non-judicial mechanisms .
these , in our opinion , should reproduce the levels of consumer protection , safeguards and environmental safety currently guaranteed by EU rules within the Community .
we also insisted on the importance of Parliament being kept duly informed about the actual implementation of the assistance .
when the new Labour Government in Britain was elected in May , we promised we would transform our relations with Europe .
some Member States have done just this , for example , the Netherlands , done properly with the signature of the minister .
President of the Commission . - This is , basically , not a Commission competence but Baroness Ashton &apos;s competence as High Representative .
neither can Taiwan therefore be a member of the WHO .
as regards the obligation to consult the relevant management committee rather than simply to inform it , I am willing to examine this proposal in more detail .
we found it regrettable that the concept of microcredit was not mentioned in the original material .
I call on the Commission to take steps to initiate an additional regulation in this direction .
secondly , Pakistan takes a different view of religious and ethnic minorities when compared to the view based on the values affirmed by Europe and by advanced liberal democracies .
we need to take these big visions from countries with whom we are working and translate them into what it is that we can provide and support .
in other words , if my data is stored somewhere in country A and country A decides to forward data , will my data also be forwarded to a third country ?
now she has lost , let us acknowledge what is really happening and let us keep the Ukrainian authorities under careful observation , but let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater .
we could be more precise in terms of the timetables and description of the activities that must be carried out , and could do this in a meeting with the Committee on Employment , when we can discuss the activities and proposals of the strategy individually , particularly the five points referred to by Mr Hughes .
Moreover , we are planning to develop a new type of cooperation whereby the European Parliament would be involved in the preparatory work of delegated acts , and we would like to do this on very solid ground .
welcome
it is the same kind of policy that finally led to the intervention in Kosovo to rescue the Kosovan Albanians .
I understand , Mr President , Mrs Pack , the need to assist the new Serbian authorities in tackling the problems which exist , but this cannot be done at the expense of justice - or a modicum of justice - i.e. by failing to challenge and condemn the actions of Mr Milosevic and the main Serbian leaders .
.
in the circumstances , we can be satisfied with the overall outcome of the summit .
the good intentions of our rapporteur notwithstanding , we are worried that the European Year of People with Disabilities ( 2003 ) will be a year in which a great deal of money is spent and numerous events are staged , but which does nothing to change the situation of disabled people , especially those from the poor sections of society .
when acting as the guardian of the Treaties and watching over adherence to the law , you will always have us , the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , at your side .
more extensive and vigorous efforts are needed to redress the balance .
it is not just about providing development aid .
our government and our Labour MEPs should try to ensure that they have some kind of consistency , because indeed Richard Corbett , as recently as this week , said &apos; Tax harmonisation ?
Mr President , the discrepancy , in the Council &apos;s case , between what is said and what is actually done is particularly striking .
Firstly , the safety of eight nuclear power stations in three candidate countries is giving cause for concern .
now that Agenda 2000 refers to 11 new countries , education must be our first concern .
on refugee return , we note that the implementation of the convalidation decision for validating pension rights has begun and information on the changes to the rules has been made available to the returnee community .
now when we and the Central and Eastern European country governments are striving , within the limited resources they have at their disposal , to try to ease the traffic problems for the greater convenience of western hauliers I hope that there will be a more ready response than has proved to be possible in the past .
European Globalisation Adjustment Fund : application EGF / 2011 / 019 ES / Galicia Metal (
report ( A5-0021 / 2003 ) by Mrs Minerva Melpomeni Malliori , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries
the European public reads in today &apos;s newspapers of the arrest of terrorists in Denmark who had made definite plans for attacks .
Mr President , my congratulations and thanks to the rapporteur .
environmental considerations are not constraints or obstacles .
one key aspect that was widely acknowledged during the debate was education and training .
this is an aspect which you , as politicians , can help to bolster more than anyone else .
do we want to take on the structure of a state or will we be - what we are - under the guardianship of the Americans ?
( Applause )
I would ask that this list be included in the verbatim report of proceedings of this sitting ( 1 ) .
however , we also need better police cooperation and exchange of data ; indeed , all the tools which can be used both within and beyond the European Union should be reinforced .
enlargement to include the ten East and Central European countries on 1 May is of historic importance .
they want to contribute critically to government policy , and yet they have simply been transferred from one colonial power to another .
now you need to start putting it into practice .
but it is a question of people &apos;s right to use the road network as safely as possible .
a Community which subsidises this tobacco-growing and then makes it unlawful to sell it , whilst destroying jobs and the lives of ordinary people who rely on revenue from goods which are not even sold in the Community , cannot gain the respect of ordinary people .
in addition , it is vital to promote mutual understanding and knowledge between peoples and cultures , through specific actions on various fronts .
the time is ripe to take the process of joint reflection on the future of our social protection systems a step further .
( ES ) I am satisfied with the way in which the Presidency of the Council has answered my question , and I think that the Immigration Pact is an important step .
I wish you every success in your work , Mr President-in-Office !
( PL ) Madam President , listening to today &apos;s debate on the Seventh Framework Programme , I would like to take the opportunity to draw your attention to the preparations for the following programme , the Eighth Framework Programme .
I have a list of four pages and I will not read them all .
the Foreign Affairs Committee may be unhappy about this but it was probably about the best deal that could be done in the circumstances .
at that time certain restrictions were imposed , but they have not proved sufficient to halt this uncontrolled advance .
no state that is in so much debt as to be on the brink of insolvency can get out of the debt trap if it has to continue to finance this debt by borrowing at high interest rates .
one of my colleagues mentioned modulation .
finally , I want to thank Mr Titley for his report on the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports .
therefore , if someone wants to apply to it due to a European Union decision or the application of Union law , they will first have to apply to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling .
according to the ILO , roughly 218 million children are involved in child labour at present .
this House is , of course , very aware of these concerns .
while the Commission has not received specific complaints regarding the Austrian legislation , I would remind the honourable Member of the study which has been commissioned to report on all the national rules applicable to the various forms of gambling services .
the next item is the statements of the Council and of the Commission concerning the Social Package ( Second part : cross-border healthcare ) .
it would be less costly for it to compromise these policies for the benefit of European businesses and employees .
but it is not just a question of writing off debts that can in any case no longer be recovered .
however , those instruments will not prove effective unless we also achieve closer cooperation between the institutions and the security forces of the EU Member States .
I sincerely hope that the Commission finds another way forward to test the safety culture .
in short , this is a more transparent solution that offers greater security for the market and greater protection for the consumer .
the errors on the part of individual Member States , and I would be most interested to know which Member States , is only one side of the coin ; the irresponsible conduct on the part of the Commission is the other .
this week I noted that the Council had opposed text in the report by Mrs Ferreira , the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , concerning the symmetrical approach .
Unclear concepts such as &apos; safe third country of origin &apos; or &apos; safe third country &apos; have led to a situation in which we are frequently at odds with internationally agreed practices or the principle of not sending people back , which we have made sacrosanct .
concentrating on the plight of migrants traversing the Mediterranean , Europe and the North African States ( Maghreb ) have to work in unity .
at the same time , however , the exercise of the right of free expression , as of any right , entails a great deal of responsibility , on the part of both individuals and institutions .
we are all looking forward to the new treaty .
Besides , the position adopted by the Commission on these amendments will be clear from the opinion I have just delivered .
however , let us not keep the current structure as the sole reference .
in its declaration , the Luxembourg Government advocated the reinforcement of its institutional mechanisms and the integration of gender into all its actions and policies .
I think that the review of the ATHENA mechanism by the Polish Presidency will solve the budget problem .
I rebel .
Commissioner Monti will remember that on one occasion in the last Parliament he had to come in when a debate had already begun , because of transport problems .
the result is a sensible document clearly focusing the priority on environmental protection , the security of energy supplies and participation in Asian energy industry markets .
the report shows the extent of the problem , or shows how many opinions there are on this matter .
they lie at its very heart and consist of much more than the acquis communautaire .
the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has voted against certain elements of the report , either because these fly in the face of our political conviction , or because the areas involved should fall within the remit of the Member States rather than that of the European Union .
I believe instead that we must build a school where Catholics , Muslims , Protestants and atheists can all live together .
obviously , the positive outcome of the conciliation is already bearing fruit , even before entering into force .
here is the explanation of my vote .
the framework guidelines of this initiative must now be converted into action and the Council will of course make a statement on that , in the light of the conclusions of the European Council and with a view to the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Baltic Sea Council , which will take place in Kalmar on 2 and 3 July 1996 .
between having everything or nothing , Parliament insisted on a sensible solution that consists in closely monitoring strategic acts .
Mr President , I would like to express my satisfaction at the outset at the progress that has been made on this proposal for a directive on food supplements .
Fiscal consolidation is entirely necessary , but the goal is growth .
the recent disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , which has caused millions of barrels of oil to be discharged into the sea , has drawn the world &apos;s attention to a subject that is fundamental for the European Union .
while there are clearly reservations about this , introducing a collective defence clause in the new Constitutional Treaty , similar to that under the Western European Union Treaty , also seems a necessary step .
he or she will also have to state quite clearly , however , that the EU first needs to be given the necessary strength .
I tried to do it from the very beginning and we have the support to do it now , namely to develop a strategic planning capability which is , at the same time , both civilian and military .
the Court has had its say .
it means fewer new jobs and fewer new companies .
the reason why this progress has been made is because clearly now , particularly following events in August in Belgium , there finally exists a political will to do something to improve the rights of children within our Community .
the first is the non-discriminatory right to use short extracts for the purposes of general news programming .
we have reached a situation in which each country does what it sees fit in order to promote the policy of budgetary stability and , if relevant factors are undefined , this would be practically impossible .
I would also mention here - and you spoke about it just now - the Stability and Growth Pact .
from the point of view of the Committee on Budgetary Control , it is apparent that we still have much to do .
the precedence of policy over economy must be retained or restored .
we are going to do so , of course , both with the Commission and with the Council , because we are all convinced that the Europe we are going to construct will be neither technocratic nor bureaucratic and Parliament must therefore fully demonstrate its .
finally , I believe it is important to highlight another point of fundamental importance : Europe has once and for all made its mark as an indispensable partner in the international arena in the field of safety and all aspects relating to the maritime sector .
I have noticed that the Royal Mail has shares in a postal company in Sweden because over there , it can compete within an open market .
welcome to the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy .
that is the only way to guarantee the holding of free and transparent elections , to ensure the return to democracy of a country that has been bled dry and reduced to poverty by General Eyadéma ’ s dictatorship and to enable the European Union to resume its cooperation with Togo , which has been suspended since 1993 and which the Togolese people greatly need .
the rules on decision-making are faulty and attendance is low .
the agreements now being made in negotiations with the Member States will affect the budget for a long time into the future .
some cheeses of designated origin require the use of milk from specific dairy breeds , and in winegrowing , only traditional vine varieties may be used .
what occurred this year could be a forerunner of still worse fires in the future .
that is exactly the point made by Mr Kerr .
Please do not misunderstand me : I certainly would not wish to prevent the dreadful situation of farmers and rural communities from being given the attention it deserves at European level , quite the contrary .
this is a good mechanism for addressing issues such as mobility , work contracts and working conditions .
Mr President , I would like to conclude by saying that the Group of the Europe People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is satisfied by the work that has been carried out during the course of the third reading .
Parliament has also asked for slightly lower noise levels , to be measured .
my group has been committed for many years , and I am thinking of the creation of the single market with its four hundred directives , of the process of structural reforms which has allowed us to create internal markets within the Union .
( De ) Madam President , we need to achieve greater efficiency between the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) and the other structural funds .
this is an important step in the development of the EU in becoming a responsible player also in international cooperation , a good example of which is the visible defence of the Kyoto Agreement .
this Agreement also ensures that safety provisions in bilateral agreements are applicable to situations when regulatory control over an air carrier is exercised by a Member State other than the Member State that designated that air carrier .
irrespective of the political objectives , confusion in the principles of law and order can never be justified by political objectives .
a second aim was achieved , and Mr Spencer , the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , has expressly authorized me to say so on his behalf also .
this would particularly threaten the ecologically recognised combined production of heat and power .
until that happened , though , he said that cooperation should be on a case-by-case basis , and pointed out that there was already substantial foreign investment in the Russian energy sector , to a considerably greater extent than in many other energy-producing countries .
the movement of labour is one solution with which to overcome labour shortages in certain sectors .
the political prevalence of budgetary constraints and a rigid interpretation of the financial balance under multilateral surveillance have led in recent years to a steady decline in the ratio of public investment to GDP , although it must be acknowledged that private investment has followed the same trend .
it is therefore highly significant for two of the four priority areas identified in the Commission &apos;s proposal for a Sixth Environmental Action Programme : nature and bio-diversity and health and the environment .
following enlargement it will have 75 members , plus a number of observers .
to sum up , public finances must be consolidated , but it is only worthwhile doing so sustainably and provided that this goes hand in hand with the strengthening of the European economy and the skills of its citizens .
it is up to us , the people and states , and the European Parliament , to make the euro into a great shared house and not an unfinished tower of Babel .
it is also time to acknowledge that our nuclear power in the EU has saved many peopleʼs lives .
I consider this option to be political and not technical , or at least not only technical but with a strong political meaning .
based on the experience of the past 12 years , the proposal reflects the Commission &apos;s determination to cut red tape whilst facilitating compliance with European Union legislation , taking due account of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles .
then we have satellite navigation , the Galileo project .
the point I should particularly like to emphasise is therefore that we have succeeded in enshrining the right to appeal in the regulation , following lengthy negotiations .
there is not a single decision that is referred back from Brussels to the Member States and regions .
another bloody attack could take place at any moment .
( Parliament gave its assent )
the African Union must insist on an end to violence and the appointment of a mediator , backed by observers , who will have the confidence of the MDC .
it is a powerful tool for developing demand but at the same time , due to questionable practices , it can sometimes be a negative factor in the functioning of the market .
the Commission will be increasing the proportion of development assistance given as budget support and will seek to increase the link between budget support and progress towards the Millennium Development Goals .
do you share my view ?
Several of you have mentioned the problems of the media and private life , the problem of the system of ownership , all difficult , controversial subjects on which subsidiarity has a full role .
these are two matters with which we are now concerned and are subjects also of questions in Parliament , and the Commission , being aware of such problems , will provide at the right time corresponding and fitting replies to the same .
protection for the civilian population comes from the north , it comes from the Israeli attacks that come from Herez .
although Mrs Lambert &apos;s report on the evaluation of the Dublin system contains viewpoints and proposals that I do not support , I decided to vote in favour of the report in the final vote .
the inclusion of citizens from these countries with their fellow citizens from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Montenegro and Serbia in terms of enjoying the right of free movement in the EU will also help close some of the wounds of the recent past .
it is the main duty of all European institutions to monitor the observance of these rights .
Mr President , on 19 March the presidential election will take place in Belarus .
I still do not really think that I have had an answer to the questions I put .
as long ago as 1984 , spurred on brilliantly by Altiero Spinelli , Parliament drew up an initial draft constitution for Europe , at a time when nobody dared talk about it or even think about it .
will you instruct , therefore , the ushers to tell Parliament &apos;s staff to go back to work !
the chauffeur would be Mr Vatanen and President Prodi would , of course , be the parish priest .
I do believe , however , that this is an important political message that all of us together should pass on .
but they can be solved .
Tobacco production is extremely labour-intensive .
all new Member States receive one-tenth of the average for one old Member State .
in the area of international relations and the law of the sea , Community financial support is given for the conclusion of fisheries agreements with third countries , including partnership agreements , and participation in international organisations relating to fisheries or the law of the sea .
the disease has proved more serious and more infectious than was thought .
on the fifth aspect , that of distillation , you are right : it has to be stopped completely .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , I wish to recommend that the plenary adopt the proposal for a Council decision providing macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the in the version originally put forward by the Commission .
at the same time , a stabilisation fund will not significantly modify country-specific shocks because there is a ceiling on the EU &apos;s budget of 1.27 % of total GNP .
I remember having to cycle eight kilometres in the winter of 1944 just to get two eggs .
it has been possible to reach a balanced compromise , creating an instrument capable of dealing more effectively with this type of criminal activity , and creating more rigorous policies and making penalties more severe , including prison terms of five to 10 years and the seizure of the proceeds of crime .
the countless investigations into the tourism industry go right back to 1989 and were carried out by the Court of Auditors , the European Parliament , the Courts and the Commission itself , which is being held fully responsible for the whole affair .
the next item is the report ( A4-0101 / 96 ) by Mr Oostlander , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , on preparation of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe for accession to the Union on the basis of the White Paper on the subject ( COM ( 95 ) 0163 - C4-0166 / 95 ) .
I fully agree with the need for a strong and effective Agency and believe that this can be achieved through the approach suggested by the Commission where the Agency will develop codes that involve real substantive discretion and that these are then adopted through comitology .
in the interests of democracy such privileges should be abolished .
Salman Rushdie &apos;s death penalty has not really been lifted .
one final remark about glued ham . the discussion with consumers about whether or not they want it has not yet taken place .
market organization in beef and veal
President Papadopoulos &apos;s statements after the end of the talks in Switzerland amount to the fundamental rejection of the basic principles set out in the plan .
I think that regions must continue to be supported in their aim to fulfil the economic and social cohesion objective .
it should be pointed out that the previous proposal clearly showed how difficult it is having detailed rules that are to apply under quite different conditions .
I am pleased to see that the appointed representatives are of a very high calibre .
where there are differing interests , objectives will also diverge and it will be impossible to plan anything shared .
he asks the musicians to stand so that the audience might applaud them .
it is also a matter of respecting the environment and upholding the principle of equality between all human beings .
do not create new problems of competition in Europe .
Forty-eight of the 50 states in the American Union have a deficit budget .
I believe it should remain a clear and simple repeal of Regulation ( EC ) No 4056 / 86 .
Please continue to drive that agenda .
and in the area of animal diseases in particular we would like EUR 12 million extra to be set aside for veterinary measures and animal welfare and public health measures .
Olle Schmidt and Eva-Britt Svensson asked about the journalist , Dawit Isaak : yes , we are trying to do something in Eritrea to set him free .
I think that Nigeria should adopt this way forward , perhaps under pressure from the European Union .
just as the Eurogroup has elected in advance a president for two years , so governments should put in place other actions in anticipation of the treaty , relying on a voluntary agreement .
we can observe that there are some car companies that are coping better than others with this double crisis .
if Britain wants its own rules , it too must have them .
would it be problems with the structures behind the government &apos;s efforts which are not satisfactory to you ?
through cost-benefit analyses we will take steps to assess whether specific actions achieve their objectives , what their impact was compared to the quantity of expenditure allocated , and what European added value they contributed .
I hope that the Council will share the views of the Commission and Parliament .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , I believe that this new tragedy illustrates yet again what we might call the fate of immigrants .
such issues cannot be resolved from above .
the new development cooperation agreements must promote equality between men and women in all areas , not only political and social , but also economic .
by putting these modifications in place , we will be facilitating the acceleration of , and investment in projects that will also be important in creating jobs .
we will go ahead with our proposals .
I said a while ago that I would have preferred to go a bit further , but that I did not believe everybody was ready for that yet in their minds .
the Hampton Court summit identified six key areas , backed up by a range of specific policies , in which the joint efforts of Member States and of the Commission can bolster Europe ’ s economic prosperity and collective security .
mind you , &apos; swift &apos; and &apos; Community patent &apos; are not words and concepts that go comfortably together .
this increase , which must be oriented towards flexibility , imagination , solidarity and good sense , must be accompanied by rigorous monitoring by the donors in terms of how the aid is used and by effective tracking of the sums made available to the beneficiary countries , from their transfer to their final destination .
despite this , I believe that there are still points of concern .
Mr President , I would just like to point out that we rejected the substance of this third indent when we voted on the budget .
VII ) For the European Commission to draft a legal study to determine the way in which , within supranational institutions , particularly the World Trade Organisation and the Transatlantic Economic Partnership , these illegal advantages , to which I referred in my previous point , can be minimised .
in writing . - ( RO ) I would like to emphasize the importance of physical education classes in the EU schools and secondary schools .
on the other hand , I have been told that Kigali airport is the most convenient in terms of freight handling , and that aid is no longer being hindered at the moment .
Journalists and human rights activists are once again being threatened .
the anti-doping campaign will be in two stages .
we need to keep this matter alive in the European Parliament .
we should at least agree that they should one day be included in the Code of Conduct .
to discuss packaging solely from the perspective of waste , as we are doing now and have always done , is completely wrong .
I see this as a clear indication of the very broad consensus between the Commission and Parliament about the aims of our rural development policy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on the party statute and the resulting statute on political parties is of far greater significance than most people probably believe .
we recognise the importance of VAT as a possible way of promoting employment , but we do not support a policy in which certain sectors are promoted on an ad hoc , arbitrary basis .
some of you made reference to the issue of bureaucratisation .
Mr President , I asked a question earlier , which I consider to be very important .
indeed , they represent a considerable proportion of such energy resources .
regarding the future financing of the Union , I think it is absolutely necessary to get away from narrow accounting assessments .
now it is a matter of starting to implement the political decisions of Luxembourg as quickly as possible and of getting the Commission to come up with a suitable proposal for a legal basis as early as possible in the New Year , because we can only help small and medium-sized businesses if a legal basis is created for such expenditure .
are there any comments ?
consequently , it is what it is .
others were informed that they could begin their studies if they signed a kind of statement of loyalty to the current regime .
Acceptance of its migration across the Atlantic or , even worse , its disappearance , is like looking at the future through a rear-view mirror .
this means that not all citizens of third countries are guaranteed a visa .
I would ask the President-in-Office whether she would take into consideration the initiative taken by both Ireland and the UK in relation to technical conservation measures and see that some effort is made by all countries to try to ensure that the smaller fish are not taken on board .
I am allowing points of order because we are still waiting for some Members to arrive . Generally , points of order are always heard after the votes .
we wish , as the New Democracy Party and Greek Opposition Party , to express our profound and sincere condolences and our deep sorrow at the death of a former colleague and , I must say , a very good politician in his capacity as Foreign Minister .
those of us who are supportive of Turkey are under no illusions about the challenges ahead and the work still to be done .
and if you do not do so , I am going to call on the ushers to ask you to leave the Chamber .
it was with great pleasure that I voted in favour of adoption of the resolution on a regulation repealing certain obsolete acts in the field of the CAP , because we keep hearing that we have too much regulation in the EU , with negative consequences for the correct functioning of the market economy .
there is one thing we do not like .
the debate is closed .
next , a military force needs to be interposed as soon as possible between Israel and Palestine , as was done between Lebanon and Israel with the FINUL .
to one of the minister ’ s pressing questions about the trends in macro-economic figures , he receives surprisingly positive responses .
Mr Fabre-Aubrespy , do you agree that we should take your motion of censure together with the one which is already on the agenda ?
life does not exist so that it can be industrially exploited ; on the contrary , industrial exploitation exists to support life .
those in favour of unanimity are merely showing that they are aware of the fact that , through hard work , 15 Member States reached a pact in Amsterdam that states that , for five years , decisions in this area must be taken unanimously .
we ask the Commission and the Council to act together .
I find this irresponsible .
Madam President , yet another EU-Russia Summit is taking place this week .
the United States , Canada and Mexico have all sought to tighten up IMO agreements and the EU , especially given the recent accidents that it has had , can and must take action in this area .
I think that , following the debate in Parliament &apos;s anti-fraud committee , we can stand by the following conclusions .
specific proposals will consequently be made in the course of the forthcoming reform strategy .
I am proposing to you now a new ambition for Europe .
we have tried to display understanding for the new government as it seeks to consolidate democracy in Yugoslavia .
either some arrangement should be reached with the groups now so that we can discuss the matter again at second reading , or else my group will be forced to vote against paragraphs D and E of Amendment No 14 .
we would like to vote for that .
they are good .
it is important that we are able to respect the deadlines and agreements we are party to and , on that basis , you can organise the work as you see fit : by means of &apos; planning &apos; , &apos; programming &apos; , &apos; rolling on &apos; , or whatever you want .
throughout the whole process of this Treaty there were two decisive moments .
there need to be continued efforts to commence talks .
they are innovative and visionary and are an appropriate response to the changing circumstances in which we live .
the aim is to ensure that administrative expenditure does not increase faster than inflation .
in which case , we might see the Commission turn against any scientific analysis and leap onto the bandwagon of a public opinion largely ignorant of sea-faring matters , easily deflected and , in some cases , easily manipulated - a particularly loathsome example of which we have just witnessed .
I find it is merely mediocre .
however , we must not forget that many cases of colonial rule were also characterised by expulsions .
we cannot simply limit the issue of intergenerational solidarity to the financial sphere . we must foster a global vision of support for the elderly and for their families , particularly for women who look after elderly people .
what amounts do we need ?
however , and this is the problem I want to draw your attention to , the information on the two prisoners cannot be transferred back across the borders with the prisoners , because present-day data privacy laws prevent the transfer of data across frontiers .
having said that , the European Union must come up with appropriate instruments for promoting greater protection of those who are most helpless and most in need .
we have also made a conscious effort to get young candidates onto the list .
we have to take account of the positive experiences of the regions .
with this , you will be able to prevent exports from grinding to a halt and these products from accruing in European ports , such as that of Rotterdam .
the chosen legal remedy is unacceptable ; recommending three options at the same time does not really do anything to solve the problem that Mrs Lévai has set out so clearly in her report , and which the compromise before you aims to address .
assistance , humanitarian care and return .
I hope that has now changed .
under this name , there were technical assistance bureaux working completely properly and we could not harm them and , consequently , what we did in such cases also , was to suspend the contracts , with all that that entailed .
we reject this choice as the wrong one and , like the social movement , call for a different charter for a different Europe .
for my part , I am , of course , prepared to work with you in a spirit of mutual respect and loyalty , with the European project – that of our citizens – always our main priority .
Mr Bolkenstein , we still have a lot of work to do regarding this matter before the people of Europe see that the EU actually works for the good of them , the private citizens of Europe .
that proves that it is the manufacturer or the trader that is subsidised , but certainly not the end-consumer .
this is a very disturbing and downright scandalous situation .
farmers should not be subsidised according to past yields or land ownership .
I also see that we need this interconnection when it comes to the modal split with rail transport , so that at the push of a button the traveller knows which system is better , which is cheaper and , furthermore , which is more environmentally friendly .
in addition , developing countries are also the hardest hit by the effects of climate change .
we need a policy for this , so that we can stay ahead of such situations .
has the Council discussed diplomatic protests and economic isolation of countries such as Croatia and Bailers , which do not respect the fundamental democratic freedoms and rights that must prevail in a democratic Europe ?
I should like to look back over two other areas from last year &apos;s programme .
one reason why this is important is that the Council has taken such a stubborn attitude , essentially concentrating on the compromises it agreed at New Year without responding to any of Parliament &apos;s suggestions .
these areas are not profitable when shown on a balance sheet and so will be the first to suffer under liberalization .
( ET ) I would like to explain why I did not vote in favour of Mr Andersson &apos;s report .
the fact is that the special rules introduced in 1999 – for three years in the first instance – on reduced rates of VAT applied only to a few Member States and to certain labour-intensive services .
this decision is incorrect for at least two reasons .
many of our fellow citizens have worked hard to be in the EU , but membership is not only about duties - it is also about rights .
it does not appear that way to me !
the presidency of that Board will be held by the president of the ECB , and we will need to ensure that countries within the euro area - as well as those outside it , such as the Central and Eastern European states - receive equal voting rights in the new organisation .
the PSE Group would also draw your attention to the appeal made by the Mayor of Diyarbakir to those Kurds who use violence , to abandon this strategy , because my group emphatically denounces excessive violence .
I voted in favour of this report because the European Union must continue to enhance its security strategy , uphold its values , pursue its interests , and protect its citizens , thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and global security .
the tenth round of the Uruguay Round will have no further business .
we must ensure a level playing field throughout the European Union .
Mr President , our communication was designed to draw the attention of Parliament and of course of the general public to the importance of European standards .
Russia has decided to conclude negotiations before the end of this year in order to be able to join in 2007 .
it is also a unique opportunity for small Member States too to influence the work of the EU .
Trained hunters already take full responsibility for the healthy state of the game which they provide and will continue to do so in future .
the communication , of course , identifies principles and processes to be carried out as well as the instruments for carrying out the processes , while the directive lays down rules for identifying those infrastructures which , according to a common European approach , require protection .
we are also committed , of course , to strengthening the guarantees contained in the current agreement ; these should remain - and be strengthened - in the definitive agreement , as should a strict limitation on the end use of data and an absolute ban on extracting data and using profiles .
it is very important that we get to a situation in the future in Europe where the costs of mobile phone calls throughout Europe can be lowered and become uniform across the internal market .
obviously the report contains points which we support .
I attach the greatest importance to the establishment of some sort of watchdog , made up of representatives of employers , employees and the Commission , to monitor how the situation develops .
I have spoken to Mr Sterckx about Amendment No 60 and the block that relates to it , which is Nos 52 , 62 , 57 , 38 and 60 .
in particular , the concept of responsibility of nationals of Member States is already enshrined in the basic regulation for the common fisheries policy and should be maintained here .
I am pleased that the country has finally made significant progress in cooperating with the Hague Tribunal .
we are coming to the end and , at this point , Mrs Theato , I am somewhat perplexed .
despite all its contradictions - I was in Libya with Mrs Gomes - there is no doubt that a framework agreement could certainly make a contribution to the fight against terrorism , to fundamental freedoms and to the energy issue .
since I started going to this country , in other words since the military coup against President Chávez , I have been hearing the Venezuelan media screaming against the President , against the dictatorship .
five hundred European producers met here in Strasbourg from 5 to 7 November in order to express their concerns over the future of the COM set up in 1999 , but also to present the progress made .
therefore , as highlighted in your resolution , this semester will be crucial for Croatia &apos;s negotiating process .
above all , I want to emphasise the importance of bringing this proposal forward from 2011 to 2008 .
for example , major banks that betrayed the trust of their investors ; international advisors , who often knowingly certified false accounts ; monitoring bodies , which failed to monitor ; and – if I may mention this , Commissioner – those governments that tolerate tax havens are also guilty .
Firstly , the Oslo fundamental agreements still exist and continue to be in force .
it is time to improve the current provisions on veterinary checks on the basis of the experience which has now been amassed .
author . - Madam President , I just want to comment on two matters raised in the debate so far .
this is not about the Services Directive .
their analysis confirms the anticipated positive micro-economic impact of the euro in all these spheres , as a result of the elimination of transaction costs , uncertainty and the current calculations required by the existence of different national currencies .
Mr President , I voted for the report on our great Parliament &apos;s initiative on the serious crisis in we which find ourselves due to the spread of this epidemic amongst cattle .
Mr President , the van den Burg report on prudential supervision in the European Union is particularly interesting for the elderly and pensioners , who give their money both to the State which arranges their pensions , through compulsory national insurance schemes , and to private funds , through shares , bonds and investments .
the Commission is also proposing that firms which infringe these regulations be obliged to return the aid they have received and that they be barred from receiving any aid in the future .
the European Union gave its support to the peace process in a declaration on 8 January .
it must be possible to improve the way in which research work done in Europe is exploited in the shape of commercial goods and services .
we are currently at the stage of the first reading , and the Council is to announce its position on this proposal on 3 November .
I also asked if Mr Santer and the Commissioner responsible for farming would be present to report back to us on what had taken place between them and the demonstrating farmers .
the proposed document reflects the interpretation of the European Court of Justice &apos;s ruling of 12 September 2005 adopted by the European Commission , and allowing the use of criminal measures at Community level , if they are necessary for the successful implementation of Union provisions .
we in the budgetary authority had hoped - just as the Commission had hoped - that this money would be used to ensure fair and free elections .
Madam President , on a point of order .
Unfortunately it has come to pass that various Member States - perhaps like lazy or careless building workers - did not adhere to the stability pact and created excessively large government debts , budget deficits .
now , with Pat Cox as our President , we must confront it from day one .
– Mr President , the number of people in gainful employment in the EU will decrease from 303 million to 280 million by 2030 .
if we want to do this properly , we will have our hands full .
however , I think it was important to visit him .
we are developing measures to support the transfer of research outcomes and their transformation into tangible , marketable products and services .
it is also important to establish what is covered by the protection and , therefore , the ensuing liability : who is liable , for how long and to what extent .
the first is that peace certainly cannot be established in the east of Congo until the FDLR are prevented from doing harm .
that is the important point .
in addition , longer dry spells increase the likelihood of fires , which we can address by thinning out woodland to minimise the fire load .
– Mr President , the Commission has finally acknowledged that the different economic and social realities of the various countries calls into question the rationale behind nominative criteria in applying the Stability and Growth Pact .
neither can the Commission accept amendments which dramatically alter the original text , or stray too far way from its spirit or legal basis .
VAT fraud is a criminal activity which has a huge impact on budgets , with illegal refund schemes being used in all Member States , Romania being no exception ( for example , carousel fraud ) .
in the UK , we consume very large amounts of pre-packed sliced bread and I think there is a very strong argument for exempting that from the regulation altogether and allowing Britain to sustain its current regulated pack sizes for this very important consumer commodity .
we do not consider any further , supplementary resolution on this topic to be appropriate ; rather , the whole issue would be given even more weight , in our view , if something were to be framed to form part of the Copenhagen declaration .
the maximum price for outgoing and incoming connections will be reduced each year by 4 cents , and in 2011 will amount to EUR 0.35 and EUR 0.11 per minute respectively .
now is the time to put our detailed criticisms to Turkey and to demand answers .
I am convinced that the Doha negotiations will make a great contribution towards making the multilateral trading system and its rules more development-friendly .
in writing . - ( SV ) We vote against this report because , as usual , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament seeks to introduce amendments aimed at transferring more money from the EU budget to the agricultural policy .
we hope to be able to find alternative ways of strengthening democracy by continually assessing the human rights situation and considering what sort of relations we should have with Uzbekistan .
in the short term , we remain committed to its being referred to in Article 6 .
the first important milestone for Belarus will be the parliamentary elections and the referendum scheduled for October .
so anyone wanting to achieve progress in this field must submit themselves to the rigours of communitarised progress , and that is what Parliament is urging you to do .
at the same time , the World Bank and the UNDP are talking of growing poverty , increasing social maladjustment and record youth unemployment in Russia .
report ( A5-0209 / 2003 ) by Mr Miguel Angel Martínez Martínez , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on the Annual Report 2001 from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on EC development policy and the implementation of the external assistance ( COM ( 2002 ) 490 - 2002 / 2246 ( INI ) )
on this occasion , the government has acted swiftly and has taken decisive action to prosecute the perpetrators .
Mr President , the utility of the European arrest warrant was illustrated , especially for my constituents in London , when Hussein Osman , a suspect in the 21 July attempted bombings , was returned to Britain to face justice in weeks rather than years .
the EU must cancel the Association Agreement between the European Union and Israel while Israel does not comply with international law and humanitarian law .
we also believe that environmental problems are cross-border in character and that there is thus added value in dealing with these issues at EU level .
Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking the Finnish Presidency .
we believe that it is important to ensure that all directives which are considered relevant are transposed into national legislation and that their effective application is monitored .
before communicating the result of the election of the President-designate of the Commission , we will wait a few minutes for Mr Barroso to arrive .
at the same time , this presents an outstanding opportunity to make people aware that they must take responsibility for themselves in these matters .
our institutional overload , as we all know , is quite dramatic in the Union and with enlargement it will get worse .
I see a solution in the wide-scale introduction of automated intelligent consumption metering systems and of systems providing up-to-the-minute snapshots of energy consumption , including ones for household use .
in presenting this report I would like to emphasise that the Committee on Transport and Tourism approved it almost unanimously , deeming it to be both important and necessary , and that it brings in a new level of quality in that it extends regulations concerning the transport of dangerous goods to passenger trains .
as the rapporteur emphasises , however , its development is conditional upon a number of precautions being taken .
obviously it is entirely consistent with the main objective of this proposal and it will ensure that an equivalent level of safety will be achieved for all high-speed passenger craft operating in European Union waters , irrespective of whether they are engaged in domestic or international voyages .
we have to look to the future .
there is a risk of excessive bureaucracy .
Moreover , I welcome the fact that Amendments Nos 3 , 4 and 7 were rejected by roll-call vote .
can regional policy aid , or any other form of Community aid , have helped Ericsson to set up in Scotland , and if so , what lessons does the Council believe should be learnt for the future distribution of aid ?
Mr Siekierski &apos;s excellent report deals with how to distribute food to those most in need .
I voted for this report as did most Labour MEPs because I feel that in this highly charged and controversial area , the rapporteur has achieved in her resolution a good , balanced approach .
a great deal has been said about technical contribution , industrial application , the meaning of computer-implemented invention ; the conditions for the industrial use of an invention based on software filed for a patent must be extended to the product as well as the method .
certainly , there is a need to cooperate on making vaccines available in special situations ensuring , perhaps , that a vaccine is used where it is most needed .
having said this , it is clear to me that Member States should have the possibility to develop financial assurance solutions at their own pace which are well adapted to their own needs and institutional conditions .
after all , if you were putting out a football team to represent you , you would not select them en bloc .
in reality , of course , consumer protection is something more .
you will be aware that , according to our Rules of Procedure , this amendment must be approved by plenary if the President sees fit to put it to the vote .
Mr President , it must be very difficult for the Commissioner to come here with a brief that he may not know quite as much about as some of the speakers .
to my mind , greater transparency must be an absolute priority .
I am a European Muslim .
that is , in fact , the incentive we wish to provide , as it is in fact small and medium budget productions or coproductions which do not have access to private market loans , except at a very high cost .
the first reason is that I come from a Member State from which Andorra is probably a long way distant .
it touches on the principle of subsidiarity and I personally believe that the reference to exceptions weakens the principle of equal treatment .
where does a person spend the most important years of the social integration process ?
consequently , in agri-monetary matters , the difficulties that have arisen as a result of changes in exchange rates , and which have had agri-monetary repercussions , will disappear .
I believe that this support and this clarity are what the European public needs .
. I want to commend Mr Putin .
Firstly , they are cheated in their home country , often handing over their life savings and more to ensure passage and work in the European Union .
finally , I just want to say a few words about public access to information on the environment held by the EU &apos; s institutions , since this issue has also been touched upon in the debate .
Accordingly , product placement is prohibited in information programmes and in what are known in English as ‘ current affairs ’ programmes .
if we want to do this and have a credible system , we need legal clarity and a system which is manageable and which can be applied .
our future will be in outside hands , therefore , if we do not change the situation .
the market is free only when rules are clear , mutual and applied .
membership of committees and delegations : see Minutes
Mr President , Cuba is clearly a very sensitive , as well as a very complex , subject , and I do of course agree with those who say that the European Union , and this Parliament in particular , should work for more democracy and respect for human rights across the world , and that is also true of Cuba .
in writing . - ( FR ) The Castex report on the demographic future of Europe is appallingly trite , featuring all the clichés one might expect to find in surveys on the subject .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I agree in many respects with what has been said here today .
if the Council had been more generous , many institutions and individuals would have put money on the table .
the European Parliament delivered a favourable opinion on the agreement on cooperation and the Customs Union as early as 9 June 1992 .
. ( FR ) We obviously denounce the heavy sentencing and the attacks on freedoms in Cuba , without forgetting , however , the immense responsibility of the US , with its economic embargo , its political pressures , and its military threat , the objective of which is not to ensure more independence for the Cuban people , but to strangle this small country which has dared to escape from its direct hold .
we need think only of the many conflicts in North Caucasia and Transcaucasia and the dangers that have re-emerged there too .
these observers concluded that the elections were free and fair .
the Commission must look at these issues and put forward proposals to us , perhaps by way of the Green Paper .
such initiatives should be taken on a basis of close coordination between the Commission , the Member States and the relevant sectors of the industry .
it is , then , high time that the European Union itself got involved in Geneva , in order to bring in a resolution and win the support of responsible members of the Convention .
in some countries , people are trying to deify the idea of public services without asking themselves whether public services are really services to the public .
if we apply this , it will result in an appreciation in value and price of exactly the quotas that you are phasing out .
first of all , there has not been a significant improvement in the enforcement of human rights in China .
the Member States are wasting huge resources on ineffective controls at the internal frontiers , while at the same time there are not enough resources for combating international crime .
but in any case it is an area which manifestly relates to health , to the demographic phenomenon of the ageing of the population , and also to prevention .
well done for this initiative !
human rights campaigners and opponents of the regime are oppressed and persecuted .
the EU is one of the global leaders in the field of research and innovation , including in the agricultural sector .
Clarification is still urgently required .
we are against the bulldozing of rights , especially in the case of fundamental rights in Europe .
the Commission would do well to realise that the efforts of fisheries ’ producer organisations , in particular – including across borders – will be indispensable to a genuinely rigorous approach to the fisheries issue in the future .
I remember the effect in my country when lorries of strawberries were overturned by French farmers .
we really must act on it .
the power of the Ombudsman to conduct own-initiative inquiries is the key to the opening up of the institutions .
we must translate the wishes of the Luxembourg Employment Summit in November 1997 , where the 15 Member States decided that it was a priority to ensure that no young person was out of work or without training for more than six months , and no adult for more than a year .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( SV ) Mr President , so for the thirteenth year running the Court of Auditors has rejected the implementation of the EU budget .
this is the Community solution to the issue of innovation availability and I hope that this House will support it .
there is no such political initiative on the nuclear weapons programmes of some EU members or the United States - or even the nuclear programmes of Israel , Pakistan or India , countries that have not signed the NPT but do have nuclear weapons - the United States already having stated that it could use them offensively .
indeed , from a strategic viewpoint , how could we not recognise that it is in the vital interests of the Russian Federation , a country that we all regard as an essential partner for the European Union , to stabilise a region that is crucial as regards access to the oil from the Caucasus ?
further on in the text it says the opposite , that tax competition and tax dumping will force a &apos; code of conduct &apos; into being , in other words that countries will undertake not to introduce taxation policies which are in conflict with the &apos; interests of the Union &apos; , or alternatively will lead to tax harmonisation .
the protection of the euro will be the responsibility of both the Community and the Member States , however .
why did I vote for it ?
we have , furthermore , put commercial concerns above children &apos;s rights .
in the case of five of the proposals mentioned in the communication , the Commission recommends that the legislative process be proceeded with , although it does , before this happens , wish to submit in-depth economic analyses in order to help the legislative body to come to a decision .
does the Council intend to propose structural measures to improve working relations at European level in order to remove the strong opposition and protests that we see on television in all the Member States ?
by seeing the absolute value of human life , we can build a society of compassion and love .
but for the brave , opportunity .
in that respect , the EU underlines the importance of these elections being held in a peaceful , transparent and fully democratic environment .
it is not difficult to see why the European Parliament and the Council have supported Romania and Bulgaria ’ s European Union aspirations .
Mr President , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wishes to withdraw Amendment 32 in favour of Amendment 27 by Mr Méndez De Vigo and Mr Lehne , as the two amendments have the same aim . we would therefore ask Members to vote in favour of Amendment 27 instead .
but where are they when it comes to the financial action plan and the regulation of investment markets ?
as Mr Daul rightly said , that is how to make the life of a Finance Minister easier - by indicating new own resources for the budget and reducing the direct contribution .
actually we are trying to make a contribution regarding the promotion of a harmonious society , stability , unity .
I think there are three essential conditions if actions are to measure up to intentions .
changes to the rules will be necessary , as few as possible .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mrs Roure for her persistent work with the Council in putting together this framework decision .
finally , with regard to the outcome of last weekend , there is no doubt that the failure to agree in the IGC represents a setback .
in this report Parliament has significantly improved the Commission &apos;s proposal and it is one that I can fully recommend to this House .
thank you , therefore , to the civil servants who support us .
Mr President , like many here I welcome the report and congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done so far .
it is a form of cooperation and , together with this request which the European Union should make , programmes such as the one we are discussing are examples of how much the old Europe , the European Union , can contribute to a world which is different from the one proposed in other places .
because of quality problems Latvia &apos;s manufactured products find it difficult to enter the EU &apos;s western markets .
the report also refers to Article 280 of the Treaty of Amsterdam , which opens up new possibilities for the control of fraud on a Community-wide basis .
it is based , as always in the field of agriculture , on the fallacy of overproduction .
massive amounts of money have apparently been spent on corrupt electioneering . this will have a detrimental effect on the delicate economy there and push up inflation .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , anyone skimming through Mrs Buitenweg &apos;s report and listening to her statement might think that these proposals of hers are actually quite straightforward and thoroughly acceptable .
it is a great privilege , after 10 years of working in the same committee , to take the floor at what is practically the end of the parliamentary term , in one of the very last debates , and to do so among one &apos;s friends . I should like to say what a pleasure it has been for me to work with such strong and such brilliant personalities ;
secondly , where a certain ACP country has violated human rights or there is a serious lack of good governance or democracy , the EU-ACP Assembly can send delegations , draw up reports for discussion in the Assembly and take measures on that basis .
( De ) Mr President , we have seen that World Women &apos;s Day was marked in Iran by demonstrations by women , which were then violently suppressed .
I believe that , amongst other things , this will start to set in motion a process which may lead to reforms in Palestinian self-rule ; after all , elections are not that far off .
in writing . - ( HU ) What does Europe mean to us ?
the Open Society Institute talks about prejudice and violence faced by Roma communities across Europe not decreasing .
we thus need not only to strike the right balance in terms of joint financial responsibility but also , furthermore , to avoid scaring off potential partners in a consortium , the only participants in which will therefore be established bodies , when what we want is to foster the participation of small and medium-sized businesses .
this certainly needs to be tackled urgently .
the industry itself has begun to develop alternatives such as organic acids and oligosaccharides .
Regrettably , I repeat , I am not of the rapporteur &apos;s opinion .
so I think this report on the single market represents a further step towards the European institutions being able to say with a clear conscience that , if the division of tasks between the regions , the Member States and the Union works properly , then they do have something to offer .
Unfortunately , where this report is concerned , I have the feeling that the desire is to fight a terror spectre that , fortunately , does not exist in Europe in this highly organised form .
yet Europe is still displaying the same stubborn desire to ignore the reality , which is that today , one State is making great use of its colossal power to impose its hegemony .
at the same time , more democratic reforms in the country have been instituted and the standard of living of the Russian people has been increasing steadily .
