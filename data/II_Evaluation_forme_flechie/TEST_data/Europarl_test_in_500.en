What needs to be done in order to break with these policies and make a greater commitment to production, to jobs and to valuing labour?
So if I voted in favour of this resolution, it is because it intends to remedy these ills and promotes the introduction of a tax on financial transactions which would have the advantage of limiting speculation on financial transactions, of regulating the markets, of financing public assets, but also of reducing public deficit.

I am convinced that a trade agreement of a pronounced neo-liberal nature between unequal regions - unequal in all senses of the word - would simply increase that inequality and promote exploitation by a business elite, leading to an even greater cycle of dependency, exclusion, poverty and extremely high social and environmental costs.
- Before the vote:
The Member States and the candidate countries must now translate their words into genuine action in order to put an end to this loathsome trade.
I have had enough of the knock-out argument, which is always trotted out, that research will move abroad.
Once again - and in this House - we reaffirm the importance of the introduction of an article in the Treaty of Amsterdam providing for differentiated and specific treatment for the ultra-peripheral regions.
However, I too want to thank everyone who took part in this report and underline one very important point: what Parliament is offering today in relation to the legislative review of the electronic communications sector, as already stated by Catherine Trautmann, is wholly consistent and, we believe, will be very positive in terms of developing this market.
Firstly, the special Agency for Fundamental Rights has been set up.
You can see it with the naked eye.
I have decided to abstain from the final vote on the own-initiative report by Mr Eurlings on Turkey's progress towards accession.

We will thus make no proposals going beyond them, nor will we make proposals binding the European Union beyond 2006, so that it is perfectly clear that the Commission's strategy involves no financial risks.
Steel, cement and ceramics would still be produced and we would have to import them into Europe, adding the cost and the emissions of the transport involved, while we would theoretically still be complying with that emissions reduction.
Another challenge we shall have to take into account is another round of international trade negotiations.
We should offer them a warm welcome.
Mr President, I should like to remind Parliament that Mr Demaçi was also awarded the Sakharov Prize, so we should invite them both and mention them both; otherwise, it is not worth doing.
Service providers must comply with stringent requirements, and this compliance must be monitored.
This is a total perversion of justice.
Let us imagine a city with no police.
Then there would be no reason for Israel to take action outside its own frontiers.

Tomorrow, God knows.
However, there is one matter where the Central Bank needs to take the lead.
We cannot take our leave when it suits us.
That shook people's faith in food safety.
The African Union, the European Union, the UN, neighbouring countries, the Contact Group and, last but not least, France, have all been called upon to play their part in ensuring that the four (at a minimum) different political movements that there are in Madagascar can find common ground, that Madagascar does not become a failing state, that it does not drift further towards catastrophe and that, instead, it finds a peaceful and negotiated solution.
I had the opportunity of discussing this with Commissioner Liikanen at an earlier stage but I would also like to say it in public.
I think that is precisely the line we should be taking, in other words, not only should Parliament be kept duly informed, but since so much has been made of transparency under the European transparency initiative, a fully comprehensive array of documents should also be made available on the Internet, so that they can be called up any time, and can, in their turn, help enhance the credibility of what we all stand for, namely the development of a new Europe.
That is the idea that led to the suggestion made by the Commission, namely type-approval of hydrogen powered vehicles.
Yes, it is meant to have at least three senses.
A common policy on investment will promote high quality investments, sustainable economic, social and environmentally friendly development, and will have a positive impact on economic progress worldwide.
Some Members of the House may have seen the brochure that we prepared for the Ottawa Convention review conference last month, which shows the breadth of the interventions that we are making, covering every corner of the world and every aspect of mine action.
Does the Commission consider that it has provided information to the Member States that raises doubts about the real origin of all products exported by Israel?
A particular feature of that is your House’s dialogue with the Ukrainian parliament.
I hope that Portugal, particularly with its new Government, will be less blinkered than the Socialists and at least give consideration to this prospect.
I am convinced that, if such a brutal form of mutilation as this had been forced upon our male fellow Members, the issue would have been resolved long ago.
One of the most obvious failures of the EU's external affairs policy is the lack of a common policy with regard to Russia.
As protection of the soil is closely linked with the main international environmental challenges, there is a need to consider Community legislation which is specifically designed to protect the soil itself and which can encourage the exchange of information and coordination of good practices among the Member States.
Ukraine and Belarus might become members in the future for example, while we cannot imagine the same of Russia.
Integration in the first place has to start with development.
Colleagues, we shall only vote now on the two Caudron reports. The remaining items will be held over to the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, following the debate on the Pérez Royo report earlier, your fellow President announced that the vote on that report would take place tomorrow.
I would like to single out a few aspects which could be significant for tomorrow’s vote.
– Mr President, beyond any doubt, the enlargement of the EU by the accession of ten states is an event of historic magnitude.
However, while such actions are so long awaiting definition, they do not make up for the need to define a comprehensive European line on food policy and food safety, which will give the many European diversities another opportunity to display their unity.
I would simply remind the rapporteur that, in the recitals, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted 2005.
I say that is another question altogether.
As soon as the words "techno' or "bio' are used, young people are likely to be supportive.
One of the conclusions of those multilateral consultations had to do with the need to give the exchange markets the freedom to reflect the fundamentals of each economy, and this is the best way for exchange rates not to be collectively detrimental to the players, the participants in the international markets.
It wants this cooperation to begin from March, and I am very grateful to Parliament and, in particular, to you, Mr Lehne, and to the members of your committee, for the pivotal role you are playing, with the Committee on Legal Affairs, in order to make progress in this work and to produce results quickly on this matter.
The solutions, as the Commission points out very well, involve the diversification of supply sources, especially clean sources - those which do not produce greenhouse gases.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur's recommendations on the preparation of comprehensive and integrated financial planning so that the funds can be allocated to projects aimed at achieving the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, rather than to actions that merely consume these same funds.
It is for this reason that it is so important that Parliament should endorse the conclusion of the agreements.
I voted in favour of both the compromises reached in the difficult trialogue negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
I wholly agree with the rapporteur on the absolute necessity of clear information on the results obtained and the resources needed to obtain them, and on the need for citizens to be completely informed on the cost of the European Union's policies.
. Mr Ebner refers to the need to protect children and young people from aggressive advertising for ringtones, mobile phones, games, etc. and asks whether the Commission intends to take action on this.
That could serve as an opportunity to promote European dockyards, thereby establishing a European preference in the domain of ship repairs.
But be that as it may, as the longest-serving member and in all my work at the Commission I have to my knowledge never, never, condoned fraud of any kind.
Madam President, the key word in this report is cooperation.
Again, there has been a very massive growth in cross-border child pornography.
Madam President, we wish show the support of the Spanish socialists for the text of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and especially as it is arranged.
On the other hand, the question of our regulation is of great interest to us.
A threshold of EUR 500 has, however, been set, and larger anonymous donations are only permissible if they are made to absolutely organisations.
As some Members have already said, we are seeing cancelled or delayed flights, passengers being denied boarding, problems with baggage and so on.
There are two ways of looking at this.
Well, if I read Paragraph 21, which merely sums up all elements of the EU policy that can be achieved at the moment, that is an enormous agenda.
It includes far-reaching chapters on Services, Procurement, Investment Protection, Intellectual Property and Regulatory Cooperation.
One, we will have the austerity package in place, much to the chagrin and pain of our citizens.
On the one hand there is a proposal to move away from the historical reference values, and yet on the other hand there is a proposal to sanction huge differences in direct support for farmers from the individual Member States.
At the same time, digital television improves access for people with special needs, such as people with impaired hearing or vision, by providing auxiliary services such as better subtitling, sound commentary and sign commentary.
It is clear what action must be taken.
And neither will I do it in Spanish, in this Chamber, while the Basque language does not enjoy full recognition in our country.
By deciding to vote yesterday on the report by the Committee of Inquiry and the oral questions relating to that text, Parliament indubitably weakened the censure initiative and so helped to undermine one of its own most important prerogatives.
The incidence of obesity amongst our youngest citizens has reached epidemic proportions.
Consequently, measures in favour of rural development will depend on the funds available under the second pillar of the CAP and any funds obtained from reallocating resources which may be released at the level of the first pillar of the CAP as a result of the reform under way.
But we buried a heroic man, and not the courage he inspired in others'.
With regard to the proposed amendments to the 7th Company Law Directive, the obligation to draw up consolidated accounts has no real justification, because the consolidated accounts would, in this case, be almost identical to the non obligatory individual financial statements.
There has been a parallel achievement in southern Europe.
The vast majority who travel abroad do so either on holiday or on business and they like the availability of duty-free.
I would say that as long as the second piece of luggage does not consist of several bottles of booze, then it may be possible for the crew of an aircraft to manage to accommodate it.
Again, we are still waiting for a response.

There are reliable estimates to say that if the present state of the disease continues, every other 15-year-old girl in South Africa will die of HIV-AIDS.
The debate is closed.
Almost on a daily basis, the Commission is now looking at the effect of the bail-outs that are taking place in the context of the current financial turmoil.
in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report, because following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU's common commercial policy became one of the common EU policy areas where the EU is given exclusive competence.
However, at the same time as implementing measures aimed at reducing corruption at international level, both inside and outside the frontiers of the Union, I feel it is both useful and imperative that, as a priority, Europe reinforces the fight against corruption within its own institutions by using firm and visible measures encompassing prevention, detection through increased controls and sanctions for all forms of corruption committed by natural or legal persons.
That too is an item for debate, but I am full of hope that on this too we will make a great deal of progress during our presidency.
In the view of the Court, the Commission should set a good example in its handling of the expenditure it administers directly, that is to say expenditure on the Union's internal policies and external actions.
Moreover, the European Parliament should not at this stage call for an extension of support after 2013, since that would be to disregard the results of the policy.
Speeches relating to points of order
The rarity of these diseases creates challenges both from a scientific and an economic viewpoint.
3.
The first lesson is that the European Parliament has new powers, it has clear powers; it has a say and it wants to exercise those powers.
Quite a few speakers have referred to pilotage.
In addition to that, we must take a series of principles into account.
Thankfully, the new supervisory architecture will go a long way to ensuring that is the case, and today we will hopefully complete the picture through the AIMF.
They are also a risk, but I obviously encourage you to have a small number of clear ideas that can always be communicated to all Europeans.
More specifically, as regards the indigenous Mapuche communities in the Neuquén region, we share the concern of this House and I am able to inform you that the current situation is as follows: the Argentine government has not rejected political dialogue with the European Commission on this matter, quite the contrary; it has accepted a plan under which, on 15 February this year, the Secretariat for Social Development of the Nation has, in agreement with the Governor of Neuquén and the indigenous communities themselves, set up a committee whose task is to propose a resolution to this conflict within 90 days.
They may be voices of accord or discord on some of the issues, but it is a really vital time and I hope the House will find within its mechanisms, and through the groups, a willingness to explore and create this platform, to express in a parliamentary sense this new Europe.
11.
I was therefore a little disappointed with your input with regard to what the European Union could do.
Thank you for your attention.
The importance which Members attach to the future of the Palestinians and the peace process gives me confidence that the European Union will manage to adopt a common approach to tackle the region's problems.
For this to happen, however, there has to be a European criminal code, Madam President, which I have often called for.
the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should support the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, and I would reiterate that assistance from the EGF is not a substitute for measures that are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor is it intended to finance the restructuring of companies or sectors;
The resolution incorporates the priorities set out in the Commission's communication of last October - to reduce the number of injuries and deaths resulting from alcohol-related road traffic accidents.

The innovation that we need must not be stifled by misguided legislation.
But what she saw was no figment of the imagination; it was a demon which, unfortunately, is more alive now than ever before.
On this basis, I believe we can find a fair and reasonable way forward to the benefit of liner carriers and of the EU economy as a whole, and one which all participants in the market can support.
I would like to call upon the European Commission to provide adequate material aid from the EU to assist the victims of the disaster and to help clean up the area.
The second ambiguity is we are told that the new directive will enable the market to be opened in a gradual and controlled fashion.

Mr President, with Nelson Mandela' s farewell as President and the election of Thabo Mbeki, South Africa entered a new political era.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, thank you to Mr Parish and, of course, also to Mrs Lulling for this oral question and resolution on the EU beekeeping sector.

The drug companies are our partners.
. Mr President, Mr Schmit, Commissioner Borg, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European Union is enduring and debating one crisis after another, the affirmation of belief in effective multilateralism and in a strong United Nations is a credo around which most of this House, along with the Council and the Commission, can unite.
We would strongly recommend that the Council does the same.
More Community agencies!
The question and the way the question is posed is far from unambiguous even within the walls of Parliament, as previous cycles and indeed the most recent one indicate; this is perhaps why the problem has not yet been resolved, even though in recent times the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has made great efforts to assess the situation and to bring about change.
rapporteur. - Madam President, before you proceed to vote on Amendments 49 and 67, could I ask that you reverse the order of the vote and vote first on 67, which is a later compromise that emerged after the vote in the committee?
The sanctions as such were also part of a debate as to what should be regarded as serious and what not.

There are still, however, considerable doubts about what really lies behind this decision.
And I have to note to my horror – I have to say I really am horrified – that the publications of some non-governmental organisations, which are made with the best of intentions and draw attention to serious problems, have resulted in dramatic and sensational reporting in the media, especially in those countries bordering on the Czech Republic, with dire consequences.
The Treaty of Lisbon has given the Union a voice through the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission.
Application of Article 296 is retained as per the current legislation, but misuse is prevented.
I would like to thank you once again for your very constructive cooperation, not only – I am saying this as the Austrian Presidency of the European Union nears its end – in the field of sustainability, but also for all of the constructive cooperation between the European Parliament and the Presidency.
Because groundwater differs from one area to the next, it would at present be counterproductive to impose compulsory quality standards to be applied uniformly throughout Europe.
In exactly the same way as Coca-Cola, they want to include Feta cheese, Parmesan, Spreewälder Gurken (Spreewald Gherkins), Karlsbader Oblaten (Karlsbad Wafers), Thüringer Rostbratwurst, and also Tiroler Speck – from both Austria and South Tyrol (Südtiroler Speck) – with their trademarks; not because they consider them particularly good, but because there is money to be made from them.
In Article 4(2), we adopt and put on the record our prohibition on discrimination within the internal market as a domestic market.
It should be available before the end of 2008.
We shall have to make every possible effort to scrutinise international law for ways and means of developing a code of conduct that will justify the conviction on moral grounds of the European firms which violate these principles of human rights.
We cannot continue giving aid and maintaining intensive trade relations as if there were no problem.
I believe that these major export subsidies are basically divisive and destroy the agricultural market in large parts of the Third World.

Let us see the others.
The British authorities have requested the extradition of only one person, Andrei Lugovoi, but the murder was not the act of an individual: a team of trained operatives were involved.
Developing countries will be faced with a cost of about EUR 100 billion to reduce their emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change.
I therefore say once again that only five years after the introduction of the euro can we truly accept full liberalisation, since before that time we are unable to capitalise our companies - in which there is enormous investment that must not be frittered away - in such a way that they are able to withstand competition.
An inclusive internal political consensus on the way forward remains elusive.
Mr President, firstly I must congratulate Mrs Torres Marques on her report and thank everyone who has participated in this debate today.

Thank you, Mr President.
However - and the developing countries are right in this respect - we must demonstrate that it is possible to organise economic growth and prosperity without doing so at the expense of the environment.
The European Parliament responded positively to this initiative by the Commission because it rounds off the three basis reforming directives, the other two of which cover protection for employees from mass redundancies and during corporate restructuring and all of which aim to reduce the insecurity of workers as a result of structural changes.
The rapporteur focuses a great deal on the need to reduce the capacity of the Member States' fleets and to establish a system of penalties that will compel the Member States to 'comply with the provisions requiring them to reduce their fishing fleets under the MAGPs' .
Second, the EU should not rob Peter to pay Paul: it cannot present itself as protector of the environment having failed to promote mandatory general regulations prohibiting the import into the EU of illegal timber that has not been sustainably felled.
However, I would like to take this opportunity to put forward my own personal view of the way in which the Council is attempting to strengthen the conditions that are essential to ensure ferry safety.
By promoting and facilitating legal immigration, Europe will not only be combating the shortage of specialists, but also the trafficking in human beings and illegal immigration.
The Commission has made proposals for that.
in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to vote 'no' in the final vote on this report.
Iraq must pull itself together.
Lawyers will not have enough time to prepare the cases, and for Basque political prisoners, an impediment will still remain to their being assisted from the time they are arrested, by lawyers they can trust.
We must make an effort to reach agreement and we need to keep an open and tolerant mind on this matter.
Nevertheless, we will have to examine the Commission's proposals carefully.
- the promotion of legal immigration, as part of a global and horizontal approach, commensurate with each Member State’s actual capacity; special emphasis must be placed on working in tandem with countries of origin and transit, not least by means of information campaigns.
one: improve the quality of fixed-term employment by ensuring the principle of non-discrimination is applied and
If we understand this and come up with a good diagnosis, then the disease may well be curable. If not, it will simply persist.
The concept of good governance is very vague, and people do not really understand what you are promising them.
5.
Today, Thursday, the Austrian Members of the Group of the European People's Party rejected the joint resolution by five groups - including the PPE and the PSE - concerning the financing and completion of the Ukrainian nuclear reactors Khmelnitsky2 and Rovno4.
That means that the consultation and service capacities have to be expanded to make it easier to identify potential assistance areas.
This is due to the intransigence of certain Members from the Parliamentary Socialist Group who I believe are less concerned about the living and working conditions of immigrants than about making political capital and taking advantage of them for party political reasons.
Bulgaria has also applied to join the European Union.
However, we should remember that natural disasters are becoming increasingly common and are so destructive that insurance companies are refusing to insure against these kinds of events.
We have to deal here with opponents - perhaps I should say partners at international level rather than opponents - who are very very strong in this sector, especially the United States.
That will definitely not, though, put a stop to his commitment.
We are talking about food for European citizens and incomes for those who live and manage the rural environment.
Mr Watson may be happy with that, but I am not, and I hope that the prime ministers will get the better of their finance ministers when it comes to real investment in the modernisation of infrastructure.
. Mr President, I indeed believe that at a time when the people of France are debating the Constitutional Treaty, the signal to send out is not one of scepticism with regard to enlargement.
We cannot accept this resolution.
At worst, it could be said that Israel is defying its trade agreement with the EU.
In economic terms, this is the law of unrestricted freedom of trade, from which, for historical reasons, the big American companies are able to profit most.
I think this is unacceptable, and the EU can no longer allow itself to be sidelined by the United States, but must adopt an independent stance.
Much progress has been made in the field of legislative organisation by means of the Schengen Agreements, but it is the case that certain countries are still resisting this progress and are not participating in it.
We will have 12 levers: 12 specific but not exclusive proposals.

Mr Ford recognised the interdependence that is surely one of the hallmarks of our globalising world.
Agenda 2000: Economic and social cohesion
That is why they cannot be taken hostage either to the present institutional crisis in the European Union or to the fact that certain European countries dispute the enlargement strategy.
The issue then is to try to get protocols to deal with the issues, that is the sensible thing: not throwing away parts of the Constitution that have been agreed upon by Parliament, by the Council, by 18 countries across Europe, but to try to find and accommodate the difficulties and analyse what the difficulties are in those countries which have voted 'no', or perhaps others which have reservations.
Furthermore, today as you did last week, you mentioned what is incumbent on Member States and I think you are right.

This is, then, the responsibility of the Member States.
Whatever happens, we want that date to be kept to; it is a duty laid upon us by history.
The first point concerns the death penalty in Ukraine.
I should also add a small critical note, because impact studies lead me to the conclusion that, in Europe, certainly after the EU’s enlargement, it has become more difficult for European fruit and vegetable growers – who generally work without subsides and in a market-oriented manner – to keep their heads above water.
It is now up to the Commission to put forward concrete proposals on how to fund the individual programmes from these overall figures that have been agreed.
Both they and the European Union will profit from improved transport links, since this can further strengthen export and trade.
The report endorses this viewpoint to the extent that it considers this to correspond to an intermediate stage between the rigid application of the Pact and the crucial development towards an interpretative model, which it considers to be inevitable in future, taking account of more sophisticated criteria such as inflation, employment, public debts and changes in these debts, financial burdens arising from the ageing of the population and investment requirements.
Like the US Administration, which expressed this view yesterday through Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, we call for an end to the spread of settlements, particularly in East Jerusalem.
We can accept Amendment No 113 in part, but the Advisory Forum should not be compelled to meet six times a year.
Unless we consider this report within the correct context, we will be lashing out in the dark.
However, from a global perspective, and here I would ask that you look at the electric car figures for China, we really have to move up a gear, as the Commission's communication states.
However, there has now been a new development: since last week, you will have been aware that the Irish presidency has made its own proposal for a draft joint action on the freedom of movement of third-country nationals in the European Union, on the basis of Article K.3.
But we do the Commission and the Council to respond to the challenges raised by the impact of economic and monetary union on benefit systems and on employment.
I share the argument that there is a need to postpone the date of entry into force, to enable businesses to adapt to the new rules.
I remind you that, currently, registered partnerships between same sex and different sex partners are only possible in the Netherlands and in Belgium, countries where civil marriage for homosexual partners exists.
The topic is of extreme importance, and looking at the habits and operation of credit rating agencies, it always has relevance.
Lastly, I want to mention the financial package.
I am thinking of the urban environment, housing and social housing.
Where the budget is concerned, the proposed distribution over three months at the end of the year is also very important.
Prime Minister Lipponen furthermore stated this to the press on his visit to Parliament earlier today.
They are a vital generator both of jobs and of innovation and new projects.

I hope the Guineans have the resources to monitor what is happening when the EU fleet is there.
It is not about turning back time: it is about getting the governance right today for the challenges Europe will surely face tomorrow.
Yes to the strategy, but no to the directive.
What purpose do clauses about respecting women's human rights in the Cotonou Agreement serve, Commissioner, if there are no sanctions?
What we are doing here is acknowledging that there are different regulations and guaranteeing to the different countries that they can maintain protectionist legislation with regard to their companies, their national public or private market leaders.
