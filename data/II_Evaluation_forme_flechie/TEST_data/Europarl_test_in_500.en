Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ferreira, and the committee for this excellent report.
The objective of this year's budget has been to unify Europe, for enlargement means that there is a need for a range of new initiatives.

Immense misery was inflicted and still persists to this day, while those responsible are still at large, because not all victims have been recovered, many of the deportees were not allowed to return home and, above all, because the misery inflicted is not recognised by many Serbs.

It is true that Parliament has managed to gain an extra ECU 70 million for two years for one of its priorities - the Socrates programme - but it must be emphasized that this boost for Socrates is due to Parliament's "intransigence' , since despite what the Council said in Amsterdam about giving priority to education, its proposed financial backing for the Socrates programme in 1998 and 1999 was way below what Parliament had requested.

B5-0776/2001 by Fraisse, Eriksson, Morgantini, González Álvarez, Ainardi, Figueiredo and Uca, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group,
This mechanism will support the functioning of the Euromed Free Trade Area, but will mainly bring stability to bilateral trade relations between the European Union and the Arab Republic of Egypt.
Over the last nine years, 77 European airline companies have gone bankrupt.
The Commission has proposed that the starting date for the transitional period be changed by replacing the date of the Regulation by the date of publication of registration of the products in question.
With the weight of the rulings of the Court of Justice on the Community's exclusive competence behind me, I must say that I am very much in favour of the renegotiation of these agreements, both because they go against the increasing importance of European sovereignty and because this draft decision is in line with EU competition and budget law.
The Lisbon Strategy has none of the informed criteria that would explain the reduction in budget deficits and in public indebtedness or the creation of 6.5 million new jobs.
Mr President, the EU thinks that this gap between the standards that exist and compliance with them must be closed in future.
Karzai, who is seeking to be the embodiment of that option, has come up against a major obstacle, namely his own person.
I concur with the rapporteur in affirming the great importance of 'territorial cooperation', which aims to remove physical, administrative and regulatory obstacles and reduce the 'border effect' between regions, promoting their harmonious development.
This pact should not have rigid rules but should at least encourage stability.
All the measures that have been taken to combat terrorism and that are now in force are measures based on the existing legislative framework or are measures, such as the European arrest warrant or the framework decision on terrorism, which were planned well before 11 September. Furthermore, in the case of the European arrest warrant, there is no doubt at all: we were asked to introduce it by the Heads of State and Government in October 1999 to replace extradition.
Quality is a key issue for the entire food chain and an essential asset in supporting the competitiveness of European food producers.
I see sustainably managed forests as being a sort of green lung.
I thought that a useful addition by Parliament and even the Commission was in agreement with it.
Approval of the compromise means agreement at first reading, which means that these improvements can actually be carried out in the short term.
If we send spectators the message, 'Look, the European Parliament wants to meddle in the world of football in order to make the spectacle of football less spectacular'; if we are going to say to the big clubs, the ones that have real customers, real social demand, 'Look, for the sake of the principle of solidarity, your income is going to be restricted, you are not going to be able to sign up the big players and you are not going to be able to have those structures.
Approval also has to be given to efforts to establish sustainable growth through a whole series of initiatives, including, amongst others, the Lisbon objectives and the major public works programmes that are currently being planned.
We hope that this latest position statement will yield more results.
Secondly, energy security must be part of a responsible peace and development policy for the EU.
Among the statistics, one figure is of particular concern: in 2008, 1 100 children were victims of road accidents in the European Union.
A hearing on this report will be held on 26 January 2006.
The balance of populations and regions on the Committee of the Regions is not at all a reasonable one.
Something similar might be said of other sectors including postal services or telecommunications, not to mention the financial sector.
So, yes, some progress was made, but not enough to compensate for the omissions.
(B5-0181/2003) by Mrs Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the renewal of the EU Common Position on Burma;
The European Commission proposes to finance Natura 2000 by integrating it in the ERDF fund and in the rural development fund.
Still you urge national parliaments to break the law.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I ask you to remember, this morning, the tragic events which shattered the hearts of many Europeans exactly forty years ago this week.
I am not happy that many of the Member States have not yet done their homework.
That has been the case with each new accession.
First, because of the situation since 11 September: we have not merely shown our solidarity with the United States, but we have also adopted measures.
Furthermore, particularly in the light of current events, enhanced cooperation could be initiated, for example with the OSCE or even with the ‘alliance of civilisations’ – which, as we know, is a Spanish–Turkish initiative under the auspices of the United Nations.
Mr Medina Ortega, all I can do is constantly remind the French authorities of the regrettable state of transport provisions to Strasbourg. I am doing this, and last week I spoke to the minister concerned.
Essentially, these amendments provided that Member States that have no railway system are exempt from the obligation to transpose and implement this directive.
This is a call to the Commission - we want measures to reduce private motoring and meat consumption so that we have more grain to feed people!
We have to stop allowing two-ton monsters to transport people who weigh 80 kilograms.
For European citizens have not died and others have not lost everything in these disasters simply because the elements were unleashed.
You only have to look at Lithuania, near the top of the world league for corruption, or to the United Kingdom, locking up people without charge or trial, to realise that Europe can very easily allow its values to be betrayed from within.
As to the European Development Fund, it is correct that, in respect of the past, financial aid will no longer be given to three OCTs - Aruba, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands - because their GNP is now near or even higher than in the Community.
Prime Minister, I know this is a European not a Finnish project, but you are particularly well placed with your former President, Mr Ahtisaari, involved in the status talks on Kosovo and your former assistant, Olli Rehn, as the Commissioner for Enlargement.
A little over a year ago, the world was stunned by the consequences of the earthquake that devastated Haiti, killing more than 200 000 people and leaving behind a trail of absolutely horrific destruction in its wake.
We want to do this, not least with a view to responding to Japan’s concern over a possible future lifting of the EU’s arms embargo on China.
I believe that, on the basis of the suggestions in Malcolm Harbour's report, the Commission will produce a comprehensive, easy-to-understand handbook to provide in particular small and medium-sized enterprises and appropriate authorities in the field of public procurement with assistance in implementation.
Lastly I object to the idea that appropriations in the reserve can only be released after Parliament has been consulted.
The first concerns Amendment No 4.
This resolution, as has been said, is a good indication of how we can bring committee business to plenary level.
The road to peace and safeguarding the future of humanity lies in respecting the principles laid down in Article 7(1), (2) and (3) of the Portuguese Constitution.
According to the 13th annual report on the application of European Community law, the Commission, in 1995, was notified of 265 breaches of the law in spite of the fact that there are over 200 legal instruments to protect the Union's environment.
The Commission will attempt to do all in its power to ensure that the implementation of the conclusions of both this and previous reports correspond to the wishes of Parliament.
I know from personal experience that the President?in-Office can deliver both, and thus close the circle from Copenhagen to Copenhagen.
Switching to different functions in the countryside will definitely have an impact in the sort of rural and urban areas that we have in the Netherlands, where plenty of proposals are ready to be tabled in order to make changes by engaging in reconstruction in rural areas.
Europe's environment remains in peril as climate chaos draws ever closer and voters must see that the European Union can lead the fight back.
Genetically modified organisms - particularly when used in food crops - have been the topic of intense debate within the Union.
I wanted, however, to draw your attention to the considerable amount of money that this represents: EUR 20 billion a year.
But it is and remains just a compromise.
The European Maritime Safety Agency cannot and must not replace the International Maritime Organisation and its members, who bear chief responsibility for the safety protection of life at sea and the environment.
Encouragement must be given to the spirit of enterprise and to flexibility in the labour market, and countries must work to promote a better relationship between work and family life.
It is a difficult balance to strike, and one which I believe should be given careful attention.
What we have done is to launch an initial attempt to cover three- and four-wheeled vehicles too, but we are also aware that the inherent problems cannot be resolved overnight.
They are there all the time.
That does not prevent us, nor dispense us from seeing how we can use the instruments within our reach to make our contribution to the achievement of the objectives you have described.
(B5-0237/2002) by Medina Ortega and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on torrential rain in Tenerife and Eastern Spain and climate change.
Public works contracts (vote)
Mr President, as has been brought to our attention today, European health services are in a most unsatisfactory state, but things are far worse in Africa.
The Danube strategy is a common project where all the partners must fulfil their commitments to ensure it works and achieves the adopted objectives.
We all know how important the car industry is in the EU.
One of the principal reasons for that is a policy that has been one of the European Union’s biggest failures – the common fisheries policy.
The Republic of Korea is already a key partner for us, and is becoming more important politically both in its own right and also because of the difficult security situation on the peninsula which has potentially global implications.
Social-democratic Germany has embarked on this path, as has centre-right France.
The matter of discards is another issue that we have talked about for ten years.
We need resources for this!
Half of the Austrian border is shared with countries wishing to accede to the European Union.
Mr Barroso, what is the real reason for your Commission's opposition to a financial transaction tax?
I fully support the rapporteur’s point that there should be national support schemes.
Well, as I have also said in my introduction, there is agreement on the political content, and we are now trapped in a legal issue.
The passenger vehicle market in the European Union today is fragmented into fifteen completely different national segments, which creates distortions and penalties that affect not only the citizens but also the automobile industry itself.
Secondly, as regards what I would like to see in the EFSF, it is not a question of liking, it is a question of policy: we in the Commission are actively working with the Member States, specifically those in the euro area, to reinforce the EFSF's capacity for lending in order to expand the scope of its activities, including greater flexibility.
I apologise for this but we have to keep to the time.
At the same time, it goes without saying of course that we must guarantee safe food for the citizens of the EU and, that being the case, we must do so throughout the entire chain.
That is an extremely poor yield for now in the fight to reduce this Parliament’s unnecessary costs.
I said in June that this will be essential in reaching a deal.
10.
In order to go beyond it, we will need to do what your predecessor, the current Italian Prime Minister, said yesterday and draft a new and simpler text, which permits limited, but crucial, reforms.
There has been a whole range of figures suggested, ranging from five million passenger movements to the Commission's 25 000.
I can assure you that these boats make a hell of a racket and produce an awful lot of exhaust, much more so than cars.
(Applause)
But there is no overall plan in place; this was a response to the UNHCR proposals in the discussion with donors for better planning so as to know what to do and not be burdened down with red tape, as Mr Knolle called it.
However, there are special rules to determine where a worker is insured when he or she works in two or more Member States for an international transport company, such as a road transport company.
Over the past eight years EU observers have been reporting on crucial elections, thereby contributing to reducing conflict over the electoral outcome or highlighting areas requiring urgent electoral and political reform.
So far as I am concerned, the whole shark fin regulation has always been too weak.
On the contrary.
We will work to ensure that this intensification of relations continues and we look forward to the active employment of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and the further evolution of our relations with Hong Kong in the years to come.
Some have an interest in our debates on the environment.
Let us begin in this House, where no smoker respects the smoking ban.
Perhaps we could also have an impact analysis of this sector so we can learn which measures have the most efficient and quickest effect.
There would be better incentives for having children and establishing a family, which would be a positive counterforce to the ageing European population.
First of all, I believe that we must simplify the budget procedure itself and ensure that it is made more transparent.
I would also like to tell you that, following the Bulgarian Government's decision to withdraw its candidate for Commissioner-designate, it has put forward a new candidate.
I believe that it is the EU's duty to encourage a process for establishing democracy on sound foundations so as to discourage the conditions for replacing one form of totalitarianism with another.
I would like to ask about this: what is the Council's view regarding the agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which has been so long awaited?
Lastly, in relation to corporate governance - which other speakers have also mentioned - we ought to take a much harder look at investment funds' managerial pay and reward policies.
I believe there is now a chance to restore democracy and the rule of law.
Anyone deeply concerned about equal opportunities needs to make sure not only that the overall objectives are right, but that the detail is right too.
rapporteur. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first idea I wish to get across is that relations between the European Union and China are continuing to develop favourably, although not always at an even pace or at the desired speed.
That is real democracy.
This is no way for a Parliament that is supposed to be serious to conduct its foreign policy and relations with other countries in other parts of the world.
Madam President, while I welcome many of the improvements that have been made, I want to make a point concerning the management side: we would very much welcome some recycling facilities, given the sheer amount of paper that appears every day, much of which is not kept.
The trend towards commercial consolidation also causes particular anxiety because of the consequences that this has in the distortion of competition, and these consequences have, quite rightly, been described in the opinions that you have put forward. But very many speakers have spoken of the dangers facing many small shops and of their survival.
I hope that this kind of rapid consensual cooperation can be taken by us with many new initiatives in the same field which are already now in Parliament or expected later this year and next.
The fact that the US is supporting its strategic NATO ally (so that Turkey would clear the way for Rasmussen to become Secretary General of NATO) should not result in the negotiations on full membership being accelerated.
The WTO panel found that the EU market organisation of that time did not conform to WTO rules.
We believe that these specific examples will help readers make the connection between EU policy and our ability to deliver real changes to the lives of real people right around the world.
We should be very careful not to raise the issue in such a way that we create more stumbling blocks in the debate on the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol.
Since this whole process will be reviewed in 2004 let us hope that at the same time we can look into the matter of secondary legislation.
It is quite proper that the principle of minimum harmonisation is now being applied. That provides a guarantee that, as no Community act has yet been introduced to cover all the issues and considerations involved, Member States may deviate from it and go a little further.
Lawyers will not have enough time to prepare the cases, and for Basque political prisoners, an impediment will still remain to their being assisted from the time they are arrested, by lawyers they can trust.
I would like to assure you that this is not the official Hungarian position, and it is not supported either by the Fidesz or the European People’s Party.
(Applause)
In particular, they need to be coordinated at EU level and those areas need to be identified where the European Union can develop a comparative edge on the global market.
The matter will be addressed by Eurocontrol and the Ministers responsible for civil aviation in their meeting to be held on 28 January.
The directive on restricting hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment will prevent the presence of unnecessary hazardous substances, posing risks for human health and the environment in various stages of the life-cycle of such equipment, including its waste management.
Only then will steps to increase trust and confidence have any chance to succeed, because there can be no peace without justice.
Moreover, concluding a trade agreement with a country such as Syria is, given the current human rights situation, unthinkable.
Are the new Member States sufficiently prepared, both politically and economically?
There is no doubt in my mind that the euro will emerge as a sound and stable currency.
After achieving this success, as one might regard it, I was encouraged to reduce the number of amendments through further deliberation with the assistant rapporteurs from other groups. Not because there was disagreement on the amendments, but because such a large number of amendments in a conciliation procedure might be regarded as too cumbersome.
This is dangerous.
We need urgent action and we need it now.
– Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would like to make an appeal to you and as I am the last speaker, I hope that you will remember it.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 21 September, Toulouse was struck by a terrible disaster which, as Mrs Wallström said, claimed many victims - 29 people died and more than 2 000 people were injured - and considerable damage was caused to housing, schools, hospitals and universities.
Shoppers who choose produce with the Fair Trade mark play a vital role in alleviating poverty and supporting marginalised producers in a manner that promotes dignity and self-sufficiency.
One of the first priorities formulated during the exercise referred to violence experienced by children.
On the other hand, online games of chance are often played outside the territory of a single country.
Saying that is not tantamount to sinking into crisisphilia, Mr Barroso.
This particular enlargement of the European Union will be accomplished on Workers’ Day, a date symbolising our need to face up to the challenge of giving the Union of 25 states economic and social cohesion.
There are two points on which I would appreciate a straightforward answer from the Commission.
As the rapporteur on Egypt, I sincerely hope that we can take this opportunity to encourage the other partners who have not yet signed up to an agreement to do so as soon as possible.
This is also a directive of great symbolic meaning.
That is, we should intervene on the causes, not the effects.
For once, the Commission is showing appreciation of the daily lives of European citizens.
In my view, a law for the private sector will be unavoidable in Germany.
The accession process is continuing.
The aid is conveyed to its destination entirely by European NGOs, and those NGOs are required to ensure that the goods do actually reach their goal.
The Agency, as the main protagonist in this field, will have a very important role to play.
So great is this dignity that it cannot be graded, and thus it determines the equal status of everybody, no matter what kind of life they lead.
And so should the Commission, so that there is still time for us to appoint the director before the end of this year.
Apologies to the rest of you.
I know that Mrs d'Ancona is also satisfied with the interinstitutional cooperation which has been established during the past year between Parliament, the Commission and the Council in the battle against drugs.
Mr Rocard referred to 6 000 years of history, but history has speeded up as rapidly in the field of biotechnologies as in those of software and computing.
So, as long as the common budget is deprived of funds, in the real sense of the word, the problem will persist and, with time, it will get worse.
However, we believe it is important to help so that a process promoting human rights can resume, and so that democracy and freedom can be re-established, values that are clearly compatible with socialism.
Nonetheless, the Commission's vision for European tourism in the future, as presented in its recently adopted communication, is based on high quality, not low cost.
Like the rapporteur, I believe an important tool to introduce will be an effective means of managing staff members' working time, by strictly setting the number of recommended hours for each project.
Behind the technical details there lurks an important economic choice favouring small and medium-sized enterprises, which can create new jobs over the coming years, as well as favouring half a billion European citizens.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly let me say that I want no more uncertainty on this point.
There are reports by journalists but, when we requested confirmation at a formal diplomatic level, we were told more than once that this war criminal is not in Syria.
In other cases, it might be possible to get the information needed in a language of the Union which is not their own.
To conclude, Mr President, the Commission is in a position to accept proposed compromise amendments 42-63, as agreed in the tripartite talks.
As far as judicial scrutiny of the European Public Prosecutor' s actions is concerned, the Commission also takes the view that national legal channels are adequate for this purpose and sees no compelling need for a European criminal court.
Without their efforts and engagement this successful outcome, with its clear benefits for the European public, business and the environment, would not have been possible.
They must absolutely not be allowed to slip into a longer period of unemployment, because at the present time it is easy to fall from there into a precarious situation or into poverty.
But, of course, the question that arises is whether we can cope with this rate of increase without having to make decisions about structural savings.
You have the resources, Commissioner, but for goodness sake let us ensure that they go to the heart of our present-day society.
At this stage, we support the rapporteur when he stresses that the Union should not only preserve but enhance the common set of European values that are the preservation of peace, social justice, equality, solidarity, the promotion of freedom and democracy, and respect for human rights while bearing in mind that the sine qua non for social justice is economic prosperity.
Call a halt to the never-ending stream of directives and regulations which only hinder business.
I am well aware, therefore, that Parliament has recognised the disadvantaged status of islands and has confirmed that they represent a natural and cultural heritage for us all as Europeans.
This is particularly important nowadays, when more and more data are in the cloud.
If anything, it is this partisan, ideological, misleading view that may lead to the distortion of the increasingly clear and well-defined objectives that have recently been identified and pursued by the European Union, especially during the Italian Presidency.
Furthermore, the Member States do not even seem to be ready to follow these proposals, which are less extensive in comparison to the SLIM results.
Allow me to add a few words of my own. We owe it all to our ability to withstand these inner contradictions and to our ability, after countless wars and untold suffering, to allow something as awesome as the work for peace in Europe to succeed.
In November of the same year, the Council of Ministers also set up the STOP programme, the aim of which was to strengthen the Member States' ability to combat the trade in human beings.
The Prodi Commission’s initial response is already known, and it is also known that the Commissioner concerned will remain in office.
I therefore understand the concern that the local elections, which are key in terms of fostering democracy, strengthening it and establishing it, may involve certain rights being violated.
The Commission needs to play an active role, as do the Council and Parliament.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these partnership agreements between the European Union, Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo should, in principle, turn out to be good news for these populations, and good news for biodiversity.
I have twice appealed at least for a mission to be sent there.
Mr President, Gazprom and the Nord Stream consortium have been laying what is known as the Northern Pipeline since 9 April.
I agree, however we cannot simply improvise in this way in the Chamber.
However, we will continue to be available to discuss with the Committee on Foreign Affairs any concrete issues that it thinks could hamper the Agency's work.
This is why, on behalf of the UPE Group, I have tabled three amendments along these lines, in the context of the Graefe zu Baringdorf report.
1999 Annual Economic Report
I would like to congratulate President Bachelet for the immediate relief effort her Government launched in order to contain the situation caused by the terrible earthquake that has destroyed housing and infrastructure.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that women are a key to meeting the Lisbon objectives and, hence, deserve the attention of European institutions and governments of the Member States.
I can, however, assure you that the Commission will pay considerable attention to the outcome of your debates.
The KLA is a by-product that suits him well because it allows him to say that he is dealing with terrorists.
This means that what has so far often been seen as a deficiency of Brussels or of the Council will also be the responsibility of Parliament.
Three points seem to me to be important here.
To end, I would remind the House that the current Spanish government was not in power at that time in 1992.
In my view, however, we could have been more specific, more to the point, and more precise.
I would merely say in conclusion that, since we are approaching the European Decade for Health - from 2000 to 2010 - I hope that the Needle report, which we support, will generate renewed and reinforced interest in public health.
The Commission will, of course, respect the content of these resolutions.
In conclusion, we do not want a cure-all for unemployment.
Mr Karas questioned the importance of enlargement in the face of enduring significant competitive challenges that we face, such as unemployment.
And it is clear that, in view of our lack of capacity, Mr President, there is currently no alternative in the field of defence and security to the Euro-Atlantic alliance, whether we like it or not.
As the author is not present, Question No 17 lapses.
The National Security Committee officers suspected of the killing have been arrested, and the head of the National Security Committee, Nartay Dutbayev, has resigned.
That concludes this item.
We need now to criticise the majority in the American Senate.
These are amendments deleting every reference to asylum procedures, and also amendments aimed against reception conditions that differentiate in accordance with the asylum procedures applicable in each case.
This week Danish consul James Leander Nicols died in a prison in Burma.
Global inequality has increased dramatically during two centuries which have been dominated by neo-liberalism.
The granting of assistance, residence status and support to find a better alternative for labour and life will secure the cooperation of trafficked persons in criminal proceedings and make it easier to punish the perpetrators.
I hope I will have some progress to report to you in all those areas when I come back in June for the global assessment of the Tampere agenda.
One of the sectors where the results are very promising is health, so this is also part of our research, which is also, without any doubt, orientated in this direction.
Therefore, please vote against Amendments 12 and 28.
Unless the corporate social responsibility issues are understood properly, this will become another sort of shibboleth for the global economy.
It was logical that a few days ago the ECB used its most effective weapon to influence the base rate and raise it by a quarter of a per cent.
One such piece of advice would be to open the files of the repressive communist system in Yugoslavia.
In the past, we always agreed that we would deal with such issues as part of a more comprehensive debate.
I would again ask you to consider the possibility of a special UN initiative and of the promotion of others of the kind.
Do you agree with us here that what goes around comes around and that the northerly countries are now being forced to show solidarity?
I would like some clarification on that point.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
The Commissioner met him back in October.
The Vice-President of Parliament and rapporteur of this report will forgive me if I call to mind a famous compatriot of his by the name of Plato, and state that I am a great friend of Mr Anastassopoulos but an even greater friend of Truth.
It is necessary that we have security in our food supply.
I do not believe there are many other potential partners in dialogue on the Palestinian side.
As regards research on persons who are incapable of giving consent, I wish to say that the original 1994 version of the draft convention rightly gave rise to protests.
It is also because the European institutional structure is fragmentary and in need of the integrating influence of a Constitution, which is why interim institutional agreements are required, along with a prudent and lasting organisational effort.
In my opinion, however, the Commission's approach is rather less judicious, because it has chosen one that is sector specific.
They must not create barriers to legitimate trade or to competition. The judicial authorities must assess the specific features of each case.
They are the people who elected us to represent their interests and promote their well being.
It is sad to see that the Tories hold the health and safety of future generations so lightly.
Since this enforcement also belongs at European level, you can count on our support in this.
(The President cut the speaker off)
In that area G10 is proposing, and the Commission is supporting that proposal, that more exchanges of information on best practice and these kinds of efficiency studies could be undertaken in future.
I would also warn against repeatedly talking about coordination at European level. This kind of coordination could lead to additional illusory powers at European level.
We have to deal with widely differing developments.
Should there be any difficulties, the Commission is kindly requested to use its powers in the field of aid and competition rules to improve market access.
This new Directive means that the Member States will also have to set up particle sampling points in urban areas.
All of these amendment proposals were rejected.
Earlier this year Oxfam issued a report that concluded that the EU is the world's most protectionist market towards the developing countries.
During more than half a century, our Europe exported wars and totalitarian ideologies across the rest of the globe.
Demanding the immediate and unconditional abolition of capital punishment throughout the entire world today does not just mean promoting human dignity but also validating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
We must no longer blame anyone else.
That is why it is necessary for this common body of law to be consolidated and summarised to achieve a common result.
(Applause)
We believe that our proximity can and must manifest itself in the long term through close cooperation and exchange in fields of mutual interest, such as trade, justice, home affairs, transport, energy and the environment.
Mrs Jaakonsaari said that the European Union has always developed through a series of crises.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The need to guarantee the effectiveness of the right of consumption is also important so that consumer confidence in the internal market increases, as seems essential to us.
So it is important for the public debate on poverty to be an open debate involving more people, involving the people concerned, not just parliaments and social partners.
Allow me to examine the Commissioner’s communication in greater depth, however.
For this reason, as rapporteur for the opinion for the Committee on Culture and Education, I supported this report, especially the points it contained relating to the role of information and communications technologies in the training of young people and preparing them for the job market.
This exactly is its point: what kind of assistance can Members ask for from lobbies or anybody else?
