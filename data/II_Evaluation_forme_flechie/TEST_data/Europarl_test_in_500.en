I would ask you not to comply with their wishes and instead to give the proposed draft the go-ahead.
Above all we must understand that even if we put a stop to European tobacco production, smoking will continue in Europe.
There is no other solution.
We currently import almost 50% and in 10 years' time, if we do nothing, it will be 70%.
We have made interesting beginnings.
The proliferation of mafias of every kind, of terrorist and criminal groups, as well as their free movement throughout the Union, must be combated through the fulfilment by all the Member States of our responsibilities, and it is therefore necessary to strengthen controls at the Union's external borders.
In the fight against poverty, there is the risk of Member States duplicating their efforts.
In this respect, our measures must be principally directed against the organisers of trafficking in human beings and those who abuse the situation of these poor migrants.
Mr President, during question time at the December part-session Mr Pérez Royo and I put a question to Mr Van Miert concerning the legality of the aid the Spanish Government intends to award to the electricity industry.

The right thing is to learn from each other but to allow the legislation to permit adjustments according to the basic conditions that prevail in each region.
They were all Burmese citizens who are regarded as political prisoners by Amnesty International.
In this capacity, he is responsible for a 'restructuring' plan at this bank that has resulted in half of the branches being closed and the loss of over 2 000 jobs, in other words more than a quarter of the bank's staff.
Mr President, the June List will welcome Romania and Bulgaria as Members of the European Union, just as we shall welcome Turkey, the countries of the Western Balkans and, in time, Ukraine and, hopefully, Belarus.

However, incentives to take up pensions, as he has quite rightly said, remains a competence of the Member States as these may be linked with the tax and benefits systems.
The only legally watertight alternative which might also be possible would be to dispense with a statute for assistants altogether and arrange instead for the Quaestors or the Bureau to decide in what circumstances a secretarial allowance could still be granted, and also to include issues such as social security obligations and an appropriate level of remuneration in these arrangements.
On behalf of all of them, thank you very much and congratulations on this act today.
It is vital that police and judicial cooperation is promoted in the Member States and between the Commission and the European institutions.
It has been a pleasure to work with all of you on the drawing up of this 2005 draft budget, which I hope can be voted for on Thursday without too many problems.
Madam President, I am very disappointed at the current relations between the West and Macedonia.
This package of measures will play a considerable part in implementing the European Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.
Another important point to remember is that the implementation of European food safety legislation required years of work and collaboration with industry professionals, who agreed to invest in order to meet the expectations of European citizens.
We can design the tools at our disposal for maximum efficiency.
Thank you.
But there are other things, too, to bear in mind.
The question that needs to be resolved today in relation to the telecommunications market is not one of opening up the market as such. Rather, it concerns the kind of democratic regulation needed to enable market-based mechanisms to function to the common benefit in this area in which public funds are inextricably linked with private goods.
The first is about a regulation under which we and everyone concerned – primarily the European Central Bank – will now receive quarterly information on Member States’ debt.
The more the text we approve results in uniform procedures, common shared parameters and a joint debate on budget projections, the more significant it will be.
i2010: Digital libraries (debate)
For this reason, it is wrong to call on the Commission to work, on the one hand, on eco-labelling of construction materials and, on the other, on drawing up lists of hazardous places of work and on setting up environmental ambulances.
This obligation on our part also means that we must have the opportunity to choose from among various products in the same price category those that have been produced by an environmentally friendly process.
I am a UN Goodwill Ambassador for Reproductive Health.
. – Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, my conviction led me to place the emphasis of my contribution on the 20 million or so small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that make up 98% of European businesses and that account for 70 million jobs.
Presumably, they are meant to work through the Israeli public, feeling the painful bite of loss of exports and jobs, pressurising the Sharon Government to stop its crazy policies.
I believe that there is not only an agreement here between the parties but also on the part of both the Commission and the Council.
I am quite sure that we shall not get anywhere if we do what is proposed in paragraph 2 of the resolution.
I can see nobody at all here from Parliament's administration, and Mr Wynn and Mr Samland are already all too familiar with what I have to say.
Our concern is naturally not to kill off consumer credit – which, for better or for worse, has become an essential part of our lives – and also to provide a guarantee that credit will not end up being a noose around the consumer’s neck.
Whatever is recommended in future by the Convention, where my colleague, Commissioner Barnier, has ably led the discussions on defence issues - and I know that he has briefed the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy in the course of the deliberations on this report - those Commission responsibilities are at the moment pretty limited when compared to the range of issues covered in the text before us.
Basically, we are on the point of taking a step comparable to the situation in 1989/1990 for the whole of Europe.
So I am involved in the third energy package, which will be produced by the end of this month; I am also involved with the internal market review, and Commissioner McCreevy and are co-authors on the financial services review.
Clearly, alternative solutions are needed.
At this stage it is not a question of amending the directive or of reviewing its contents, but there is no doubt that certain aspects of it need to be clarified.
That is something we must avoid come what may.
That is why, when we talk of the Western Balkans, we have to say: if yesterday or this week we have a government in Serbia that says it wants to look towards Brussels, towards Europe, then for the sake of ensuring lasting peace in a region that has been a source of conflict for the past 150 years we should accept that offer and further that prospect in order to continue with the peaceful development of our continent.
Two major sets of issues have been debated.
They are here to participate in the eighth meeting between the Presidents of the national parliaments of the applicant states and this House.

The debate is closed.
May I remind you that the European Parliament called in a resolution on respect for women's rights within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation for an express provision on the protection of women's rights, together with a policy for monitoring that protection, similar to the provision applied to the candidate countries which are now about to join the Union.
We must not on any account be drawn into such games and must put an end to this situation, as I said.
This should also be an important part of our approach to the 2012 budget.
I would tackle the root of the problem, which actually lies in other matters.
Pakistan is divided by religion to such an extent, that on both sides - Christian and Muslim - people are dying, including the representatives of local elites.
Let us - at least, the Members of this Parliament - avoid entering into legal or political battles which do not fall within our area of competence. And let us avoid increasing, with our hesitancy, the despair of those who are calling on the public authorities - including the European authorities - for the material and technical aid with which, in all justice, they should immediately be provided.
Within the framework of these objectives therefore, by 2013, the crisis management policy, with the creation of a security index for farmers' incomes, will be one of the basic priorities of the European Union and will need to identify with and be combined with our policy to strengthen the fluctuation mechanism.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council is an extremely important occasion.
I would like yet again to clear up one thing.
And that is good news.
That does not appear in the report and I think it is something that Member States like my own should be urged to sign up to.
Mr President, there is a yawning gap between Parliament' s position and those of the Council and the Commission.
It is all too clear that the budget appropriations to cover economic and social problems - unemployment, social security, health and education - are certain to be at unacceptably low levels.
It is also true that various ministers, in their speeches at the last Council and in a letter that they have sent to me, have expressed their concern at the situation.
I also support the idea of a European equivalent of the FDA (Food and Drugs Administration).
It is therefore of the utmost importance that this directive is adopted now, paving the way towards a strict, transparent, efficient and predictable authorisation system for GMOs.
There is another thing, though - I am looking around to find Mr Bourlanges, with whom I did most of the negotiations - and that is something I can do.
The Commission has called for full transparency from Iran on this issue and has consistently stated that the issue of weapons of mass destruction constitutes one of the major concerns in relations between the European Union and Iran.
I am not for a moment saying that we should not be accurate in our descriptions.

Naturally all countries must make every effort to pursue sound economic policies.
There are many countries, such as my own, whose greenhouse gas emissions have increased - excessively, to my mind.
We must welcome immigrants and respect the diversity of their cultures, religions and traditions.
The rapporteur also has my support in calling for public/private investment to obtain a modern transport and communications infrastructure in the Union and I support his call to the Commission and the Council to find the appropriate financing mechanism - such as an expanded role for the EIB.
The preconditions have been fulfilled for the Council to take the decision referred to in Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession, allowing for the lifting of internal controls at air, land and sea borders.
The European Union's active participation should be based, principally, on building the foundations of a democratic country, and also on ensuring internal security.
It was almost exactly a year ago that Parliament and the Commission adopted a framework agreement that renewed the basis on which our two institutions work together, and so the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has examined not only the package you have announced in terms of its impact on the Treaties, but also, of course, the framework agreement itself, notably points 31, 32, and 33.
I cannot criticise her for doing that, but it has sometimes resulted in something like a Prévert-style inventory and the poor Commission is sometimes asked to work miracles.
The fact is, however, that Mr Borloo was very tired.
I would like to say to everyone here in the debate who has mentioned the issue of financing - Mr Leinen, Mrs Hassi, Mrs de Brún and others - that of course the specific figures are important, too.
The debate is closed.
They should seek to provide European citizens with protection from injustice so that those arrested away from home can get legal representation, interpretation and bail.

I voted in favour of both the compromises reached in the difficult trialogue negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
I voted in favour of this report because I support the need for closer cooperation between civilian and military capabilities in order to provide effective responses to present-day crises and security threats, including natural disasters.
You can take it from me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that these are the same goals that are pursued by many of the Belgian people in their desire for state reform.
Therefore, Mr President, we are opposed to this absolutely untimely proposal and we believe that Parliament should continue its work in accordance with the established procedures.
However, together we should concentrate on the fact that the enemy is not in Spain or in Germany, but rather the real problem is the pathogen that we need to get under control and to combat.
The report by Mr Sisó Cruellas refers in particular to the need to coordinate investments related to infrastructure in Europe, and also to the need to monitor the creation of the appropriate transport infrastructure for the benefit of European citizens, for the benefit of those in the professions, traders, and European travellers too.
The scope of these centres' work is also being changed to increase their role in attracting investment, to give them a regional mission and to encourage the longterm sustainability.
Examples are the management plans for Northern bluefin tuna and swordfish in the Atlantic, and the capacity restrictions on the tuna fishing fleet in the Indian Ocean.
Mr Bush's and Mr Blair's invasion and occupation of Iraq has turned into a bloodbath of innocent people, worse than during satanic Saddam's rule of terror.
It does, however, go some way towards meeting European Parliament requirements.
I hope that the Swedish Presidency is welcoming towards Iceland, but that it is also strict in ensuring that Iceland complies with the requirements for accession and that it meets the obligations relating to European legislation and towards the Member States.
Finally, Member States are making deep cuts in public spending.
These reforms really are important.
It is vital that the EU reviews its sanctions policy, not only with the aim of achieving the desired changes in offending nations, but also to ensure its own credibility.
On the other hand, the list of copyright exemptions needs to be complete.
I wonder who bears responsibility for the Romanian state having spent the money, but not in the way and for the purposes for which it was received?
It also means that the Commission has a serious responsibility, as a result of which it will not be able, in the proposals it may present tomorrow, to avoid the fact that new rules on this matter must also be agreed in the OIE, in order to bring deadlines into line and to ensure that products from vaccinated animals can be marketed, since that has nothing to do with food safety and everything to do with ethical behaviour in agricultural policy.
I should therefore like to urge that that also be put on the WTO agenda.
At the moment no level playing field whatsoever is established.
(Applause)
Why is the European Parliament pronouncing on the Constitutional Treaty before the citizens of the individual states?
Tomorrow, by receiving Prime Minister Netanyahu and then on Friday, President Arafat, we are continuing our persuasive action in favour of peace.

(PL) The report refers to many negative aspects of so-called feminism and segregation, and I therefore consider it is worth highlighting a positive example.
Hamas takes pride in the fact that, in their founding documents, the movement set for itself the goal of destroying Israel.

This would notably include, where appropriate, a coordinated response to jurisdictions that refuse to apply good governance principles.
The Annex to the Final Deed of the Treaty of Amsterdam contains a declaration recalling the Joint Declaration on Mount Athos attached to the Final Deed of the Accession Act of Greece to the European Communities.
To this end, I would like to ask that we support the two amendments which we tabled to the McCarthy-Hatzidakis report, so that the framework regulation does not disregard the efforts made to develop a coherent strategy for planning the European area.
Western Sahara
Rail transport, which is very frequently used in Europe, has been experiencing a serious crisis for some years.
Finally, a few words on the campaign which all Members of Parliament have been forced to endure in the last few weeks and months; this is a campaign through which a single producer and dealer of vitamin products has been pursuing interests of a purely economic nature.
For all these reasons I say that we need a proper, correct survey before we go on arguing about the whys and wherefores.
Passenger cableway installations
It is, among other things, effective in preventing cardiovascular diseases, cancer and dementia, a point that the Commissioner and his services magisterially overlook.
We very much hope that these negotiations will finally lead to a ceasefire agreement and the integration of this group into the transitional government.
Your chief negotiator often gave us the feeling that we were - if I might express myself in colloquial terms at this point - a bit like God-botherers who sought to question holy writ, rather than dealing with the concerns we voiced on behalf of the citizens of Europe.
We can overcome this phenomenon only when there are severe legal sanctions and when we consistently make use of them.
Regarding the report, which I consider important in raising our level of consciousness, there is something missing.
Because it is actually true that it is certainly necessary, but also right, to promote the European model of agriculture.
How the proposed measures will turn out remains to be seen.

This resolution addresses Bosnia and Herzegovina's application for its capital, Sarajevo, to be considered European Capital of Culture in 2014.

It is highly regrettable that certain groups in this House continuously condemn the situation in Cuba in terms of political prisoners, opponents of the Cuban Government but, nevertheless, avoid debating the horrendous conditions of the five Cubans jailed in the United States, who are denied family visits and fair trials.
I also found that there were certain human rights problems.
(DE) Madam President, I should just like to rule out any misunderstandings once and for all.
This situation, which is affecting the countries of southern Europe, particularly Italy - we are all following the situation on the island of Lampedusa, where more than 20 000 people have landed - and the island of Malta, has brought more than 400 000 refugees to Europe.
The European Parliament has been mute apart from a timid statement by the Maghreb delegation.

While I support an expansion of the options to be able to assess the negative impact of European regulations at the earliest possible stage, I do have a feeling that Mr Doorn will be wanting to put a stop to entirely different rules from those I have in mind.
That is where their responsibility lies.
I am sure that whatever remains to be done can still be achieved in the future.

Nobody can grant what is not theirs.
The eCall system is an effective additional feature of the overall system for protecting road users.
I believe that the European Parliament has made a great effort to achieve consensus with a view to reaching agreements on these three issues.
The first part is an oral amendment, but the second part is a motion for a split vote, which I cannot accept, because it has not been tabled in time.
Mr President, the rapporteur has had sufficient courage to avoid simplifications and to deal thoroughly with the issue in a serious and balanced way.

It is clear that under the Schengen Agreement, these difficulties are growing out of all proportion.
I think that committee would not like the fact that she has broken through the glass ceiling.
This is what the honourable Member must be aware of.
Our framework - Regulation No 1408/71 - whereby countries' reciprocal agreements ensure that people also have these rights in practice has become more and more complex throughout the years and, what with this and general bureaucracy, it is often no simple matter at all to move from country to country.
Children imitate the games which can lead to tragic results.
And we have no democratic power, no legal basis to develop a social Europe.
The list of the Members who requested the floor shows which Members took the floor under Rule 150 in the previous sitting.

In line with the Commission's proposal, this means that we can then ensure, through administrative measures, that 149 posts can be made available additionally for the 'sustainable development' priority.

The Hague Tribunal is an organ of intergovernmental cooperation.

But in my speech, Mr President, I want to touch on one single point, hoping that it can be received by you and hence it can constitute another front on which to measure, in a certain sense, the British Presidency, also because it is a subject which the European Parliament has very much at heart but on which I want to complement the British Presidency, in particular its government, for the position which it has already taken as a presidency.

I must inform you that we did not want disciplinary measures to be taken solely against players, because clubs often sell their players for purely commercial reasons rather than reasons related to sport.

Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, we do not participate in the threats made by some political groups in this Parliament, who want to take the Commission, which presents itself to our scrutiny, hostage.
We are well aware that in doing so we will have to prevent this support from public grants from being indirectly used as capped subsidies, thus once more resulting in protectionism and products being sold on the world market too cheaply.
Mr President, it is very significant that Parliament is devoting a large part of its agenda today to a debate on the future of the Union with three reports - the Hulthén, Blokland and Myller reports - dealing with three complementary aspects of the same strategy.
I would urge members of that delegation to make every effort to ensure the success of the working session, which is particularly necessary in the light of the present situation.
Thirdly, this report is ambiguous and implicitly accepts the Commission’s proposal.
More generally, in line with its mandate under the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, the Commission is continuously monitoring the economic and budgetary development in Member States and stands ready to activate the instruments of budgetary surveillance where necessary.

Approval of the Minutes
Once again there has been deceit, and in the elections the freely elected community council was dissolved, to be replaced by other individuals loyal to Serbia.

In this draft Green Paper, incredibly, there is scant reference to renewable energy sources at all.
This does not, however, mean that the EU should set up another bureaucracy for the purpose.

I would, however, like to use this heated debate and the dramatic situation in that African country as an occasion to remember here, in the European Parliament, the words of the greatest authority of the 20th and 21st century, Pope John Paul II, that a state's raison d'etre is the sovereignty of society and the people, and a condition of international peace and cooperation is respect for the right of a nation to have its existence, freedom and culture.
In this report, at the level of the Member States I recommend private/public funding as well as the promotion of a regulatory and fiscal framework that favours cultural industries, and more specifically the application of tax credits and reduced rates of VAT to all cultural products, including online works.
We have to stop now, because we have gone well beyond thirty minutes.

. (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, allow me firstly to make a very personal observation.

We have studied carefully the impact of recent outbreaks of communicable diseases, and there is significant scope for improvement in how the Community can organize itself in this regard.
And these same arguments imply that a special rule for the case of the non-transparent decision systems should apply not to the respondent's burden of proof but to the plaintiff's, to facilitate the lifting of the latter, which is actually the problem being addressed.
In the light of the enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the new European model will have to further decentralise its day-to-day management and substantially simplify its legal framework.

We Europeans are much too defensive in this respect.
In actual fact, the responsibility lies with the Commission to rework its proposal in this way, if it so desires.
This interim agreement lapses in July 2007, and it will therefore be necessary to prepare the follow up, no doubt from the end of the coming winter.

This strange war has not been won, and it will certainly be difficult to win it, but there have been some positive results, such as the mere fact that the United States has not suffered any more attacks since 11 September.

Just as alarming is the fact that, under the further subheading ‘Promoting the European way of life in a globalised world’, an out-of-date energy policy is bound up with the common foreign and security policy and the European security and defence policy in such a way that others in the world could feel threatened by this.

I am quite aware of the problems of fishermen, which we do have to resolve, but we must resolve them in some other way, not to the detriment of the peoples whose only livelihood is fishing.
These are huge things.
However, I cannot accept Amendment No 6 as it would delete the recital which sets out the basic concept underlying our proposed regulation, namely to ensure that there is no increase in the overall levels of the fishing effort in the western waters and that the fishing effort is calculated on the basis of the fishing effort actually deployed to date in these fisheries.
Mr President, honourable Members, I will just take this opportunity to add a couple of comments on the issues that have emerged as the core of the debate.

That is why the Commission cannot adopt these amendments in this situation.
It is crucial that we are consistent and specific.
It will release assets for investment that are currently tied up unproductively in collateral.
The debate is closed.
I congratulate him for this and support him, as I do Mr Lehne for his report on transparency.
Their help and ideas are needed to advertise carrots, not Pepsi-Cola, and on the kinds of stereotypes and body images to advertise, as these play a very important role in raising people's awareness.

Now it is doing the same for its chickens.
Taking the ideology out of the drugs debate means that we must stop talking about decriminalising drugs.
I have made it quite clear in the explanatory statement which accompanies my part of the budget that, despite the fact that there appears to be a comfortable margin in category 5, it would have been an act of irresponsibility to have regarded category 5 appropriations as somehow more readily available than other appropriations in other parts of the budget.
In the light of the experience before the war, it is hard to imagine the UN in this role.

If someone intentionally or illegally mixes prohibited substances into animal feed, he will also intentionally avoid these self-controlled tests.
Mrs Hautala, in the case that you mentioned and which you have consulted, there is a fact, aside from the two that the President gave to you. In the Official Journal it shows that the request came from the Minister of Justice, as it also shows in the report, but there is a letter from President Kleps, by which the President of Parliament notified the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in which the Ministry is also mentioned.
I do not know if this was lost in translation, or if Mr Frattini actually told us today, that in his view Directive 95/46 applies in this case.
What is the consequence?
The review of the common agricultural policy for 2013 should submit proposals relating to this matter.

Some, like those on appraisals and promotions, will require consideration by the Interinstitutional Staff Regulations Committee.
We need to make sure that all procedures are clarified before they are implemented.
Because this is a complicated and important topic it inevitably took some time to prepare, but we managed to find a workable compromise acceptable to the majority of this House.
(LV) Thank you, Mr President.
Mrs Mastenbroek, late-night sittings have never been broadcast over the Internet in the past, as resources are limited in this respect.
Like other Members, I wonder what the Commission intends to do about this.
Secondly, because as a rule small farmers have to do the same amount of paperwork as is required for 10, 50 or even 100 times as much aid; sometimes they have to fill out a dozen different forms every year to get a sometimes ridiculous amount of aid.
Also, we have the data protection supervisor and we have data protection directives, and the last thing we want is duplication.
Mrs Takkula's report raises a significant social problem.
In the pleadings it submitted to the Court of Justice in the case, shortly to be decided, between it and the 'Journalisten' newspaper, the Council explained its position on openness and the principle of public access to official records.
