Mr <unk> has the floor for a motion .
in its conclusion , the Council is calling for a reform of the <unk> system to be adopted after May 1998 .
in order to conclude , I would like to say that , in <unk> , I would like to make it quite difficult to find the <unk> of <unk> , which must be trying to turn the <unk> of the <unk> , but I believe that it will be difficult to find the means of an ambitious policy in a budgetary framework .
I hope that the young Europeans must not be allowed to <unk> the European Parliament or to impose <unk> , but we will be able to defend our values and democracy .
here we hope here again , which will enable us to obtain a few progress , if we do our <unk> long time .
however , they are only in the cities in cities .
let us be aware of what has been said at the level of this man , in other words , a small level .
the wisdom was very <unk> .
what is the timetable for these proposals ?
the historical importance of <unk> in <unk> is going beyond the local or national level .
I hope we will be able to present specific proposals .
nevertheless , the presidency is convinced that this approach is the most realistic basis for the establishment of a final agreement in the final term , provided that everyone has the will to reach a sufficient political will .
the Commission and the Council have made meetings with the <unk> meeting , Mr <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
the European Union , the European Union and the Community <unk> their commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and <unk> their commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and <unk> their commitment to the fight against the problems of climate changes .
the Treaty will create more transparency and democracy and the ability to take the EU action , which will enable its tasks more efficiently .
the vote must take place in principle now , otherwise it will take place this evening .
on the basis of the <unk> , the Commission would be <unk> if the deadline for membership of the <unk> <unk> could be used .
however , we believe that it is essential that the negotiations which begin , which can be difficult and long , are <unk> in certain categories of Community law .
for example , the idea of creating the networks of experts to exchange the best practice and use the <unk> has had considerable support in public consultation .
the present proposal <unk> a <unk> of <unk> , namely that it <unk> up until 30 June the system of aid so far .
on behalf of the <unk> Group , Madam President , the <unk> Framework Programme is the most important research programme for the world : EUR <unk> million million for this period and more than nine million projects financed so far .
I am a member of <unk> this morning .
because of the <unk> economic situation ( it is sufficient to remind us of a rate of 80 % and a low inflation rate of 80 % and a high level of inflation , the public &apos; s public opinion is becoming increasingly <unk> .
that is not what we have done with the amendments made to the texts .
so let these millions vote on this Treaty .
I hope that he has the situation in which I am .
we must therefore be able to take part in the context of the Geneva process and the framework of stabilisation operations in this country .
why do this mean that the most of these women are the most necessary , and is it a stable and <unk> relationship in their life ?
however , the controls in internal borders will only be considered when the Union has confirmed that the candidate country can fully guarantee the implementation of the EU acquis in this area .
in fact , I had exactly the same task of looking at these seven institutions there two years ago , and I have discovered , ladies and gentlemen , that there are two years ago .
that is why it is essential for us to make the same sense in the report on the basis of the Committee on <unk> of the general system of the general system of <unk> <unk> by the large schools .
we shall therefore withdraw the proposal in Amendment No 10 , since we have reached the vote exactly what we wanted .
the drafting of this report is , in itself , an indication of the importance of this issue and the text included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which has been involved in the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
the second point concerns the compensation of emissions or exchange of rights .
in any event , I believe that it is necessary to take account of the fact that it is necessary to take a final eye on the condition that their weight in the other decisions is equivalent to the <unk> <unk> by the Member State .
in writing , I voted against this motion for a resolution , because the objective of full employment is inadequate .
it would therefore be unfair to call for the document to be set out , but it is true that this criticism would be justified if we were faced with a more <unk> document .
there is a need to choose any other things .
although economic reality , the economic policy must continue to be set up .
indeed , if the first report of Mr <unk> has never been presented during the previous parliamentary term , the report we are debating could have been a step , but it will not be .
when Russia <unk> the <unk> of human rights ?
Mr President , you are right to emphasise that only certain languages are affected .
the presence and cooperation of representatives of the Commission at the conciliation was accompanied by Parliament .
they want to see action after 2003 , not just because of the words of the more .
moreover , there is a lack of concern about the possibility of conflicts and a lack of transparency .
for example , this is the case , for example , of the need to first use the waste of waste and subsequently , in the case of the discharge or <unk> , it is also for the selection of <unk> waste .
you have seen what has happened throughout the day with the agenda and is not satisfactory .
urgent emergency aid which is too late is the <unk> of the Union &apos; s effectiveness and <unk> .
I would like to <unk> myself with the utmost force against this <unk> <unk> in the Security Council , not only , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> mandate by the UN , but also <unk> the foreign policy of Ireland and other countries which <unk> within the framework of the <unk> .
the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is now proposing to maintain the definition of the year <unk> , which I regard as unacceptable .
this area must also be based on the basis of a few <unk> , very rare , European political projects , but the sound projects which deal with the real problems we face , the first is the first of this .
that is why I believe that this is very important .
if we want to reduce <unk> <unk> and the environment of the environment , we need to promote the <unk> that will take this approach .
( <unk> ) Madam President , we have a scandal , but this is not enough enough .
an alternative which , according to the European Council &apos; s <unk> &apos; , is necessary to protect <unk> , whereas the <unk> shows that such a Council has never been granted and that there is a political decision .
despite these <unk> , the project is <unk> to support and the Conservatives and European Conservatives certainly .
in writing , <unk> report has the merit of requesting the accounts to the Member States .
this would be a message of the international community to the parties in conflict to get <unk> .
I agree with the proposal , but I cannot stop a brief comment in conclusion : the life of Parliament would certainly be better and more democratic , but the life of Parliament would certainly be better and more democratic .
we are perfectly aware , as a presidency , of the fact that we are almost in the short term of the year 2010 , the set of the objectives set in 2000 .
in fact , the use of nuclear energy is not the same as the <unk> of the actual rules of the <unk> and safety rules which must be dealt with by the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
I also believe that a system which has also been proposed , which has also been proposed , is very likely to provide information that consumers will be able to make the best choice .
however , our objective is to make this improved , and this will particularly lead to training .
we must not go into a way on our promise on the CAP before <unk> , as we have said in Berlin .
I said that I was not fully ready to see what I have seen during our visit .
it can contribute to the peace and consolidation of democratic <unk> , but it does not do so if it is taking account of the extreme complexity of this region , if it is the central element of its strategy .
could you give us the assurance that the planned payments for the use of <unk> per exploitation , which will be introduced in the <unk> and which , as we know , will be a major environmental component , which is also a major environmental component .
it is also necessary to make sure that the national authorities are able to take the right place to provide a stable basis for the security , it is also necessary to ensure that the national authorities which have the basis of this is effective , so that the national authorities of the European Union are able to take the same safety in the new directive .
the Stability and Social Pact will be able to add the delays of <unk> which are not <unk> , so that monetary policy is being <unk> , which is , of course , too <unk> .
<unk> to the employers of third country nationals in <unk> <unk> ( debate )
I would also like to stress that , in the new agreement , this is particularly reflected in the new agreement , the European Union and the United States of America .
the advantages that it has in the field of <unk> are <unk> .
( heckling ) We have received a letter of the services of the services at all times today , I say : &quot; your question is one of the first questions to the Commission .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , after an hour of the Lisbon strategy , it is not necessary to stress the necessary nature of the consolidation of research and <unk> in the European Union .
- ( FR ) I agree with the importance of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the Council on the treatment of minorities in the regions which you have just mentioned and <unk> a kind of <unk> with the protection of the <unk> <unk> .
with regard to Mr Mulder &apos; s remark : you have seen that the budget is still under the room for agricultural policy , at the end of the second reading , the risk of a <unk> on the market of the <unk> market would also be <unk> .
Commissioner , it is a matter of urgency for you to ensure that it is up to <unk> and present here the target target of the <unk> you have set the other provisions on prevention .
<unk> is part of the Commission in April of this year in April of this year .
as we have pointed out in several times , it is an urgent requirement for the workers and the citizens of the countries in the countries at the late late , so that these workers are <unk> and that their quality of life is <unk> .
we are working on a new proposal for a directive on the supply of the supply of supply into gas , the project will be presented at the time and subject to the House in the next few weeks .
unfortunately , I cannot express the same hope with regard to the President-in-Office of the Fund and the secretariat .
at the beginning , there could be <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we are faced with a <unk> crisis that neither the European Union nor the European Union can ignore .
it must work 12 hours by day , seven days on seven .
it is even used in the steel .
although an open and honest dialogue between partners ought to be made clear , and it is a clear idea that the <unk> was to be able to say that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in England will be able to tell us that <unk> is a very <unk> .
in this context , the strategic guidelines which we are debating today are important , since they are about the content of the policy of cohesion : where the money is going on and what the sectors are .
for example , in the <unk> environment .
the Commission has tabled proposals to strengthen parliamentary control and propose other compromise solutions , but they have not been published in Parliament and the Council .
I believe that we are right to do so because , when we are witnessing the debate as <unk> <unk> , there is obviously a matter of legal measures , there is clearly after the <unk> of the European Parliament .
I welcome this statement , as the first Prime Minister <unk> said that , for the first time , such an application of the fight against terrorism has also been made as clear and specific .
we cannot have more security in Europe with less money .
in the meantime , we need to increase the share of European electricity by nuclear energy .
why do we look into this issue ?
the lack of legal basis for this sector and the <unk> of the decision-making of decisions to the Council will provide <unk> for this sector , which is currently taking place in a <unk> between large <unk> and which <unk> in the control of this House .
the second task is to ask all your colleagues to ask for their information services for companies ( because they have all of the services involved in <unk> <unk> , they should also be used as a whole of your budget to <unk> these undertakings in their own language .
I voted in favour of the report on the report on the European Parliament &apos; s directive and the Council on the obligations of <unk> and translation , whose objective is to reduce excessive administrative constraints .
it is still not even less than our <unk> in the countries of the <unk> <unk> have been reduced , but that does not prevent Europe of its <unk> .
I am pleased to be able to discuss the fact that , in future , the reform of the <unk> sector , which I will be able to respond to the Council , I just hope that I am in the same time , here in the European Parliament , to present this basis for our future discussions .
I am also pleased to be pleased today with a delegation of the Community &apos; s economic delegation of the ACP countries ( <unk> ) , <unk> of 15 members of the committee of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the extra powers .
these agreements , the nationals of these six countries , have already said that the European Union will be in the future of visa sources , at least some of them , as many of them , of the European Union , will be in the future of visa <unk> , as an obstacle to the <unk> or <unk> of services , as an obstacle to the same .
the &quot; <unk> package called for the Commission last week to introduce a number of principles which will be applied in the political and legislative proposals .
for a effective policy of human rights , it is essential that the Member States of the European Union <unk> <unk> a common policy , coherence and visible in bilateral relations with the countries which does not respect the rights of the <unk> .
so I commend Amendment No 17 .
I am quite saying that the question of how the question is to be asked for this institution which <unk> a day or the other , is not in my view .
but consultation also means of exchange .
<unk> , the <unk> of the planet must be seen in the period , so as to study its <unk> <unk> , and in particular the <unk> of human <unk> , the natural resources and biodiversity .
the <unk> is still far from <unk> .
I am thinking particularly of Romania , to Bulgaria , but I would also like to add the Balkans .
there is no doubt that the peace process will continue more <unk> and fully if the European Union is involved in political action .
if we have clear objectives in favour of the environment and the health and the health , the NGOs , NGOs and politicians , will certainly be able to <unk> , the NGOs and politicians , without any <unk> .
it is with an external pressure , in your decision , Mr President , that the Council has finally made two hundred budgetary lines , that the Council has finally decided that it could not be ratified .
faced with this result , there is quite a question of what the efforts made in order to create a policy of cohesion .
this is the reason why it is very important to pay particular attention to innovation .
for example , why , in any case of this House , does this House have been referred to the emissions of <unk> ?
it is in the context of the global strategy of the EU in the world .
our duty , of course , is to be <unk> , with a view to which the people of Europe are in the coming months .
it is necessary for them to be given a direct advantage of digital activity .
these <unk> asylum seekers , which I prefer to call for <unk> , must be <unk> in their region .
in order to be more explicit , if we want adequate safety , we must not only make guarantees for the fundamental rights of the citizens , but we must also develop the area of European justice .
he said not only in favour of cross-border areas , but also the provision of large regions of Russia .
Mr President , Commissioner , if we are in Europe , we would have had to take action , and we would have had to have technical support for <unk> , and I would have liked to see technical assistance for <unk> , I would like to hear technical assistance to deal with the problem of <unk> <unk> .
I sincerely hope that the <unk> of this <unk> crime will be <unk> and led to justice .
nevertheless , the report recognises the need to study an independent , scientific , scientific and rigorous study of the United States of the United States on drugs , <unk> and <unk> .
accordingly , the Commission cannot accept amendments which refer to financial support , since budgetary discipline must be part of the framework programme .
when I met my report by writing in July , I said that this original proposal was not good .
the general thrust of the report and the motion for a resolution presented a short note of this .
the right to access to information in environmental matters is not just a right but also of power .
it is necessary , therefore , that the <unk> authorities will focus on the education of peace .
we support the proposal to ensure that the Commission is taking a long time for all the revision of the Commission , as technical legislative measures in order to ensure that , in the case of specific amendments , the text can be available in its entirety , even in the case of specific amendments , the <unk> and transparency of Community legislation .
a <unk> of <unk> on the Internet must be established in order to establish the <unk> in order to enable them to achieve their reunification .
I hope that this is wrong and that the Members who <unk> in the next Parliament will have the pleasure to work with him .
therefore , these conventions must be <unk> and <unk> in the whole world so that all players can be respected .
this means , for example , the consolidation of public finances .
annual debate on progress in the <unk> of freedom , security and justice ( Articles 2 and 39 ) ( Articles 2 ) )
we have three years for this and , in my opinion , we are all involved .
on the contrary , they are protected by making it easier to make justice more effectively and to establish judicial cooperation in the hands of judges , and not governments , the European Union .
they have paid their life for their life the deliberate flag of those who <unk> for the right to life .
<unk> the efforts of Bulgaria is in contradiction with the <unk> objectives by the EU .
and then , we must also see that in these proposals there is no positive proposal as <unk> the <unk> report in order to allow the <unk> report to achieve a genuine economic governance in the European Union .
thank you , Commissioner <unk> .
on the last subject of this latter , I would like to speak on the very delicate nature of some groups , as this committee has not a <unk> of control but a role of information and initiative .
I welcome this debate .
in category 3 , you have introduced the allocation of the trans-European networks and the Council in the Conciliation Committee and the Council in the Conciliation Committee .
there is a serious danger that a reduction in the duration of the <unk> will not be met to the markets and <unk> the markets to send the wrong message to the markets and to suggest that the adoption of the necessary measures should be adopted .
it is the reason why I would like to <unk> the events which have led to some Members to express criticism and their <unk> with regard to the question of <unk> regulation .
with regard to the construction of the construction sector , directives are <unk> .
in <unk> , I too would like to congratulate Mr Markov and I would like to make a <unk> new <unk> in innovation .
this should continue thus .
I would like to see the United States that the United States is <unk> <unk> , and I would like to hear not British military - the current conflict in the Middle East .
we should support public services in these countries and at least provide education to children .
I would therefore say that the Treaty will assist Europe &apos; s legislation to become more social , based on the basis of the objectives you have signed with social partners during the summit .
the <unk> is completely <unk> !
I think that only a few objectives have been achieved in this day .
if you say to the governments that they have to achieve economies and reduce their <unk> , then I do not believe that they will be <unk> in the Commission , but I do not believe that they will be able to <unk> the Commission &apos; s financial situation , but because they want to comply with the financial situation .
in the case of <unk> , it is a particularly important case for the <unk> to Austria .
( <unk> ) Madam President , Commissioner , I understand that the quotas of <unk> must be reduced more and I am in favour of this .
- <unk>
preparations are being undertaken in these three areas .
plants where nuclear waste are being <unk> , and the levels of <unk> are high .
with regard to the fisheries agreements , the new committees have led the Commission to give its support to two changes at the level of the <unk> budget <unk> if the budgetary authority can agree on these changes .
I believe he has highlighted the relevant points in this report and the <unk> resolution .
through the firm pressure of its main trading partner , the EU , the EU , should be encouraged to deal with the respect of the freedoms and human rights and human rights and on the contrary .
that brings me to my last point .
I voted against the motion for a compromise resolution on <unk> because it <unk> a withdrawal by a report on the position taken by Parliament in 30 January last year .
but the problem of the restriction of access to the labour market has still remains more than 100 million citizens of Europe .
how could this ambition be done if we lose the common agricultural policy ?
the proposal is designed to <unk> Directive 95 / 70 / EC / EC / EC from the Council of 22 of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , Mr President , I am fully prepared to cooperate with the Council that you will be <unk> .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to pay tribute to my colleague , Mr Vidal-Quadras , not only for the serious issue he has made in his report , but at least as it has the case , but at least as it has <unk> the arguments and the amendments of its colleagues , members of the committee .
that is what we have achieved , as you know .
the decision on political choices is a fundamental right , but today the exercise of this right is , in practice , extremely difficult .
the worst that we can do is to delay your <unk> in <unk> of a minute &apos; s speech , but that is something you cannot accept !
there is a year , we have dealt with the <unk> report on the content of the Internet .
I hope that the presidency will ensure that the measures used to overcome the <unk> of crime will be introduced , and in the light , for some of the use of this opportunity .
on the other hand , we should not be <unk> to certain values .
in writing , we voted in favour of the <unk> report on the proposal for the European Parliament &apos; s proposal for a regulation on the proposal for the European Parliament &apos; s Rules of Procedure and the Council on <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of this resignation are the following :
this is particularly the case of inflation .
the Commission takes the view that the Commission is committed to these amendments in the work which will be carried out within the framework of the programme .
in March 2006 , we have introduced the price of <unk> <unk> with regard to the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in fact , the recent meetings of the IGC have shown that a number of national delegations begin to be asked for specific issues .
I would like to say with all that I am in favour of a country which has not voted &quot; .
firstly , I would like to ask the rapporteur , I would like to ask the rapporteur , as well as this card is a reality , that the Commission and the <unk> of the Members of the Member States have the <unk> of the governments of the Member States &apos; <unk> .
in writing , <unk> ( <unk> ) I would like to congratulate Mrs <unk> <unk> on his report which highlights the difficulties that the women of rural areas are affected , that this is on the labour market or on other aspects of their life .
I appeal to the vote of the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
I would like to make sure that you will be able to take a formal or not <unk> in this House , but we will not be able to <unk> or too much <unk> in the case of the negotiations , the results of negotiations of agreements and so .
the new round of negotiations on liberalisation and establishment of the rules of the world &apos; s trade rules must be seen in a context of all , if we want to create sustainable economic growth , if we want to create sustainable economic growth , if we want to create sustainable economic growth , if we want to develop the commercial growth of the profits in <unk> .
as Europeans , we cannot , as Europeans , continue to take place in <unk> <unk> <unk> and in the attacks on human rights .
we must , moreover , consider the effects of the proposal on small and medium-sized businesses .
this needs should be even more important in the future because women , which are born in the form of a part of these products , are today based on the labour market and should be more .
Madam President , Madam President , in a context of the increasingly complex management of migration flows and the fight against illegal immigration , we are very hard to accept this Spanish initiative , both on the basis and content of the <unk> .
as Prime Minister of Portugal said , Mr Wynn , Portugal has already made an absolute contribution to a more open society , <unk> and more <unk> .
<unk> the spirit in which we have put our support to this proposal , trying to ensure that it would facilitate the life of our fellow citizens by the use of the <unk> <unk> , but that that does not , in fact , result in the <unk> of the control mechanisms .
I believe that it is necessary to take account and inform Parliament as it must , as well as to speed up the <unk> of justice and home affairs .
having said that , the great deal of <unk> will obviously affect regional policy .
the EU must show that it is the situation .
we have backed the democrats and have backed all those who <unk> the European Union .
I can only be satisfied with the negotiations of the peace process , I can only welcome the efforts made by Parliament to ensure the political impetus of the programme .
all this is in the new criminal code .
the powers you have suggested to Brussels are : the management and definition of social protection , the flexibility of labour , the flexibility of labour , the flexibility of labour , the reduction of the labour , the reduction of the <unk> , the reduction of the <unk> , the reduction of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> of the social dialogue .
but terrorism must be fought for its political heritage , economic and social security , and safety must not be allowed to continue the peace process .
it is about a reality .
the general conclusion to do with the whole issue , Commissioner , is that the Commission must be able to make the internal organisation of the Commission , a change which is a change of the Commission &apos; s internal organisation , a change which is not the case .
<unk> <unk> to be able to take 500 000 euros to the postal service , <unk> and <unk> of visitors , <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( the President cut the speaker off )
these are the shortcomings that we must be completely <unk> !
as far as the reduction of damage is concerned , I would like to say that I am not opposed to this idea , even though I would like to say that this idea is <unk> .
we need to make more pressure on those who promised their aid to help them , as well as on the <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> and the UN , so that they produce the movement .
this is a fundamental political issue which we must respond , as the Council will soon soon soon .
I would like to <unk> other speakers in their positive response to the essential work made by Mr <unk> and the excellent work of the rapporteur , Mr <unk> .
the solution for the future is to invest in renewable energies and their development .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> of my colleagues who worked with the Italian Presidency and the Commission that we have reached a agreement .
has that been respected ?
we cannot only draw attention , rightly , to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , violations in <unk> and China , and subsequently ignore the violations which have taken place in our own country .
in this House , we will not be able to <unk> research from a peaceful solution which cannot be resolved in peaceful and political terms .
allow me to remind you of a great deal of emphasis on the need for solidarity with a great deal of <unk> in the Union .
sometimes the need to establish a minimum content and , sometimes , the possibility of setting up a simple recommendation to the Member States .
I welcome the fact that the next General Affairs Council &apos; s next item is that the next European Council of 14 , and I will conclude , Mr President , that the next European Council of 14 of the 14 of the European Council of 14 <unk> will be very <unk> .
it must allow regions , in their diversity , to complete their changes and to prepare the future in the best conditions , and to prepare the future in the best conditions , and to <unk> <unk> .
the areas of foreign exclusion are vital to avoid a <unk> disaster .
I hope we can have better <unk> on the issue for 2010 .
is it possible to take a more permanent structure in <unk> and in the region ?
in recent days , this subject has been the subject of an important controversy , particularly by the comments published in the newspaper <unk> .
the increasing prices of raw materials , energy and food products still have the risk for the poorest groups .
the debate is closed .
everyone shows that the UN &apos; s <unk> and the establishment of Russia have been <unk> and that we need to make the <unk> in the game .
( <unk> ) Mr President , I would like to draw attention to particular attention to Mrs <unk> &apos; s report .
but according to your national <unk> and , of course , the free movement of persons is being prohibited .
however , I would like to stress that there is no fraud or <unk> .
the principles of the European Union and the fifth Community acquis are used to safeguard the interests of the <unk> countries .
I support the Council &apos; s position and the President-in-Office of the ECB , Mr <unk> , expressed in his comments .
with regard to <unk> , it needs to be said that they are one of the most rigorous ways of preventing the <unk> .
the current events demand the serious and real positions of the Member States , especially the countries of the euro area .
the Commission has proposed 1 <unk> , for ten times .
the exchange of the conflict must be <unk> to cover issues as the right to return of the Palestinians , the share of Jerusalem or <unk> of the <unk> , the problem of <unk> and the <unk> of the Palestinian State , and the demand of legitimate security of the Israeli people .
<unk> , agreements between Member States - with regard to the types of violence and the scope of services that will be accessible to people - will also be able to clarify the situation of numerous people .
it is impossible to avoid <unk> when you are asking you to take steps to learn .
I have not to remind you of all attacks on the European ground over the last decade .
if we do not succeed in finding a constructive solution to this crisis , and a peaceful solution , I fear that our debate on globalisation and attempts to find constructive solutions can be found for a long time .
Europe has agreed on the conditions for the establishment of a single system for workers of the high high level of workers .
this decision must be applied for a period of ten years .
first of all , growth .
this is not a matter of a legislative vacuum in this area .
the first concerns the <unk> efforts of the Member States to identify irregularities and abuse of Community funds , although there are still many old Member States , although there are many old Member States in the age of fraud .
the regulations must be made effective in the first place .
indeed , one of the reasons of the <unk> of relations between Parliament and the Commission have certainly been <unk> by some Commissioners .
there is also a proposed amendment : consumers are in the right to know whether a product is made at the basic level of origin of origin and they must not go further : the manufacturer must say if the product is called for products of origin .
however , we have chosen to abstain during the final vote because we do not believe that it is a good idea that Europe is actually making a tax on financial transactions if the other countries do not do likewise .
the 500 000 students , the 30 000 <unk> of language and the many young people have been used in this programme with successful success , and the many young people have been used to achieve this programme .
it is therefore essential for them to continue to make their own conditions to develop and ensure that their situation on the market , in order to guarantee access to the market and the potential benefits of the single market .
the last thing that they need to do is that <unk> is a permanent disaster - the EU is still going to do so .
in this respect , coordination at European level will be central and will enable the harmful effects .
once again , the Parliament has made flexibility in its negotiations , but it is not at its political priorities .
it is <unk> that a poor country is determined in the situation of the <unk> state of money , but it is also <unk> that the case has been too long .
Madam President , Madam President , I would like to say that this programme is not the Commission &apos; s programme , but the Commission , the Council and the Council .
if you do not have any mistakes , you have sentenced to them .
it is not the time to condemn some people to produce drugs and other <unk> of the <unk> .
of course , this is a question which remains <unk> .
Mr <unk> , you once again have the floor .
the debate is closed .
however , I would like to point out here that the European Parliament has been <unk> for many years of very close relations with the members of Latin America , the rest of which the European Parliament has been <unk> with other Members of America with other Members of America who are in the face of the Members of America .
civil society of this country is a scarce state .
in order to end up this issue and improve coordination , the unity of services of the services of my own Directorate-General and the special questions of the <unk> industry , consumers , consumers and health questions have created a working group .
very sincerely , the <unk> <unk> for 300 million <unk> to 300 million <unk> , for example , the <unk> <unk> of the financial forecasts for the revision of the financial forecasts , or does the death of the financial forecasts of the financial forecasts for the trans-European networks would be the initiative for employment ?
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr <unk> and the Council of the <unk> <unk> , Mr <unk> .
it is possible to build such an urban relationship , and I therefore believe that a Euro-Mediterranean partnership is a third option between the members and the <unk> of the European Union and the <unk> of the European Union and the <unk> of the European Union , and the <unk> of the European Union , and the <unk> of the European Union .
it lays down that , in addition to what we are talking about , there are so many things that we are going to make , and this is something that is more important : that is that it is easier for Europe to have large ambitions than any small ambition .
I have the impression that this was mainly the case in the Council in which , in my opinion , there has been a fear of competition , but also the success of the way in which the way in which the way has been achieved .
nevertheless , the decision taken by <unk> at the beginning of this month is not the case of the <unk> of the trans-European networks .
you have the report and our analysis before the end of this year .
it is certainly not the best way to do .
after all , it is precisely what the people of my country want to do with the people of my country and the rest of Europe .
my desire and conviction are that this British policy too is as easy as possible .
( the sitting was closed at <unk> a.m. )
only 17 days before the beginning of the monetary Union .
it is <unk> to stress that the euro , if it is introduced in <unk> , will be new and <unk> of the division between Member States of the large Europe .
Mr President , I would like to respond in the words of some of our fellow Member .
what are the points which I find about ?
<unk> , the appropriations allocated to defence are at the expense of the United Kingdom .
we must know that .
the final version of the draft agenda , as has been drawn up by the Conference of <unk> in the <unk> meeting in 15 May 1996 , was distributed .
we are discussing the possibility of <unk> Europe as an main institution which can promote a project of democracy and stability at a time when the world is <unk> a project of democracy and stability at a time when the world is suffering in the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is the case , even though the Council has <unk> to the world of a good idea , the <unk> of the results of the results , the <unk> of the results of the results .
<unk> , if I am in favour of certain tax tax , the risk is a great deal of <unk> of the fact that the current budget is going to be reduced .
you should also remind you that there is a lack of resistance to many of the European <unk> companies and would be <unk> with our common objectives of Lisbon , <unk> increase the competitiveness of Europe .
I would therefore like to remind the Commission and the Council that there is a political will to develop all the necessary instruments to ensure that the euro is fully supported by monetary union , but also by the pillar of economic union .
we do not want to see any kind of sympathy with the <unk> population .
one such attack on <unk> is only a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and a dangerous <unk> .
the <unk> of urgent <unk> , the <unk> of urgent urgency and the emergency services are being considered , and the issue of urgency has been accepted and the same is a case of its specific situation .
furthermore , the majority of the <unk> ships would not have the criteria for <unk> because ships have less than 10 years .
the common position is already a compromise and takes account of the amendments proposed first reading in the first reading of the Commission &apos; s proposal .
the same applies to the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the citizens of the South <unk> and the threats of using <unk> violence by the <unk> .
this percentage is a danger of EUR 1 million million .
why is the Council not prepared to introduce such an report ?
they deserve each year in their opportunities for innovation and competitiveness .
some of the decisions taken in the European Union have contributed to recognition of integration and the concept of sustainability .
on behalf of the <unk> Group , Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Commissioner , on behalf of the <unk> , Commissioner , for the quality of his work and the <unk> which she has wanted to establish between the same and the rapporteurs , as well as the rapporteurs .
<unk> to interventions , starting by Mrs <unk> , to which the Council of the Council referred to , I would like to stress the importance that there have been a number of chapters that she has mentioned , more specifically with regard to the fight against discrimination .
this is , of course , a question of a political issue , not just a simple issue of experts .
Mr President , Mr <unk> , the Commission is working in a <unk> way of improving the access of European schools to new information technology .
we must defend our right to choose our right to choose when and how , in relations with <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or elsewhere .
<unk> <unk>
the percentage of women &apos; s women is of 36 % .
even if the world is becoming increasingly <unk> and that the people are increasingly involved , there will always be these major differences .
I now hope that the distribution of resources available to improve their awarding will be carried out , so as to remedy the effects of the international crisis which we are all faced with in our daily lives .
this time was a huge step for the communication and if we are <unk> on this path , we will <unk> Europe from the people .
protectionism is a bad instrument , <unk> , to defend the rights of workers .
the European Union &apos; s <unk> <unk> products , <unk> and <unk> products are only a part of the sectors which largely <unk> the <unk> of <unk> barriers .
the second question is the question of the Parliament : are we going to establish a permanent committee in order to establish a permanent committee which has been made in order to bring up the <unk> of the United Nations and in order to present the UN the UN &apos; s General Assembly .
I hope I can be able to work with you next five years .
there is a need for scientific efforts to be strengthened and , in the case of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the social consequences of the conservation measures .
Mr <unk> has the floor .
Mr <unk> has done the Commission with the funds of the Commission and it has been <unk> fraud , while the Commission has the option to take it to strict checks .
I welcome the clear position you have adopted in your report on these issues .
the first , of course , is to take account of the conclusions of Mr <unk> &apos; s report of <unk> and the need to ensure that equal opportunities exist between the various <unk> of <unk> , and , in this end , the European authority is responsible for controlling companies from <unk> .
that is the <unk> and simple , which is not justified , I would like to know what your role is in this ban .
<unk> , the energy sector should be made under control of the state , and each central area should have the support of <unk> aid , <unk> at the sea .
why ?
experience shows us the right report and the fundamental role played by the Member States of the port of the port , in combination with other instruments , in the fight against digital fisheries .
we have also agreed that monetary policy must be introduced and carried out by a independent European Central Bank .
the European Parliament recently adopted a resolution which represents the determination of the representatives of the European citizens to ensure that the fight against terrorism is carried out and efficiency .
these <unk> will then enable the forests of these countries to be protected against the illegal exploitation of the timber which is responsible for damage , economic and social damage .
hundreds of thousands of people live in a way against the war throughout Europe .
( the oral amendment was approved )
the tobacco <unk> , Mr Vidal-Quadras , has well said .
it has been said , rightly by <unk> , that industrial policy must <unk> the agenda for the European institutions .
that is not right .
but we must admit that , in the European Union , the European <unk> community is a community , within which Spain is border from the <unk> Republic , and <unk> , <unk> .
for the worse , why is the Commission called for the officials not to have the same support , so does this category of workers are the most affected , even though this category of workers is the most affected ?
I therefore await the agreement that it is also a way for us to extend and consolidate cooperation in the field .
that is how the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of <unk> have been adopted , and now the EU is the same as the same as the <unk> and the EU to vote on the Treaty of Lisbon while it has already rejected France and the Netherlands .
Spain could be a <unk> of the old <unk> that she has destroyed in his fate , as Portugal for self-determination of <unk> , but it does not take part in this role because it does not want to <unk> its commercial interests and other in <unk> .
without the subsidies for export , some <unk> <unk> the internal market for the EU , which would only <unk> the fall of prices .
it must be possible to adapt the demand for urgency for the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
it is therefore essential for us , and I am particularly grateful to the Commissioner , that the system of justice and internal affairs are in the future of the European Union &apos; s resources and environmental action for the future of the <unk> of the <unk> of the work of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we have started to deal with one of the most important problems , of course , water , of course , water in Europe and the world plan .
&quot; <unk> <unk> in the form of three objectives : improve <unk> systems , increase employment and encourage the mobility of young people through the European Union .
( Mr <unk> indicated that the amendment refers to the second part of paragraph 34 )
I welcome the fact that the Commissioner is fully in agreement with me that we cannot accept the fact that European companies are in any case to ensure that the state of the State is <unk> .
<unk> , you have had to explain to us , and that is an approach we know .
this report must take a specific chapter on the positions of Parliament &apos; s social protection .
we already know in Europe about safety of <unk> , human rights and environmental aspects , and we must take action against the greenhouse effect .
there can be one other point , and I believe that we should have one other point .
the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done so long .
<unk> , Mr Monti .

if it is true that there is a compromise in many other areas that we are debating , Turkey &apos; s accession and relations between the European Union and Turkey are not part of this .
in a context of economic crisis , this House has been told that we were faced with a crisis that has been faced with a crisis that has the new Parliament , so the new Parliament will have to be able to provide a driving force .
hopes of the patients of those who suffer from rare diseases is the fact that Europe also has the highest possible regulation as quickly as possible .
the report also contains a key element in the end of its <unk> and has led to voting against the text .
in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , we have reached an excellent balance with our compromises .
this is often mentioned here in October and November .
I hope that the defence of democratic values in the context of other tasks , and the use of the new tasks in its new task , is a matter of urgency .
Mr Kinnock &apos; s hearing has thus shown the lack of determination within the Commission , as well as the <unk> powers in the Commission , to take a full responsibility as well as <unk> <unk> .
indeed , there has been extremely constructive cooperation and I thank them .
in June 1995 , the Commission has submitted a proposal for a basic proposal for a set of guidelines on the trans-European networks .
the food chain is not a discharge and industrial waste have not their place in feedingstuffs .
it intends to <unk> the results of the facts , the effect .

and fourthly , in the case of enlargement , will you be applying , specifically in the field of agriculture and Structural Funds , a division of the budget and , if the <unk> of enlargement does not <unk> with the Cohesion Fund , in the regional sector ?

for example , he has been involved in building a fully new <unk> which <unk> Europe &apos; s history and the European institutions .
it will not be replied to the oral questions , these are not <unk> <unk> .

the Minutes of yesterday &apos; s sitting have been distributed .

we must make sure that the World market is not the force of the market in this kind of vehicles that most consumers want to <unk> .
the adoption and <unk> of appropriations must be associated with the creation of such conditions as the <unk> of <unk> with the principles of the Fund , its opportunity and a sound contribution to the development of <unk> and a sound and effective management .
the Commission has not changed for our resolution .
so , today , we are <unk> , Commissioner , and I believe that it is reasonable to ask what it is being done .
if I am pleased that a service to SMEs have been created in order to <unk> , will these expenditure be extended , <unk> and <unk> by the <unk> <unk> ?
some of the amendments , for example , are the references to what we are doing , not real legal value .
I have nothing against rights - but does the European Union have not been authorised to join the European Convention on Human Rights , Human Rights , Human Rights , Human Rights and Rights .
some initiatives have been taken , but it remains to be done .
( <unk> ) I would like to congratulate <unk> <unk> on two reasons : the new postal service and its full report , which will certainly improve the effectiveness of relations between the professional and <unk> communities in Europe .
the second point that I would like to mention has always been an issue of <unk> during these debates : the coexistence , or the <unk> , will , of course , be able to take a infringement procedure .
the proposal also contains elements of <unk> and the timetable for the risks of the obvious risks .
I would therefore like to make two very brief points .
the proposal to draw attention to the fact that the World Bank must take more importance to the threat to the <unk> <unk> .
that means that the quaestors cannot , of course , take part in the sense of financial support for the event of the disaster in the event of disaster , continuing to carry out a whole policy on planning and planning .
the next item is the report ( <unk> / EEC ) by Mrs Palacio , on behalf of the Commission , on behalf of the Commission &apos; s legal status and the rights of the citizens , on the proposal for the European Parliament and the Council ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) ( COM ( b ) <unk> - <unk> / 2000 )

they do not , therefore , affect the fact that the application of the application of the application are too dirty .
<unk> to the press , we know that it is your task that <unk> the Israeli <unk> to discuss <unk> <unk> and a daily <unk> .
( the House rose and observed a minute &apos; s silence )
we have a confidence of this nature , which is still not always clear , if it is not always clear to success .
we must therefore be able to exert pressure on Israel .
it is not a suitable structure for a Community of 25 Member States .
Mr President , as <unk> of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats in our Group of <unk> <unk> <unk> , I would like to begin by expressing some satisfaction .
we do not , however , have any choice .
that is all the most regrettable that the elections have been made in a better way , in which the freedoms of the meeting and expression have at least been fully respected .
( de ) Madam President , Madam President , this is not the case of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , as Mr <unk> said .
both of all that is not the Commission , it is very important .
the Parliament has a key role to play in enlargement .
however , we must also consider that the European Union has a considerable amount of money in the form of a programme of aid for a year , in the right of a programme of aid to <unk> , a programme of aid in certain sensitive regions .
it is therefore all the more important to have statistical information and <unk> .
I am pleased that it would be appropriate to refer to the common vision of the common agricultural policy ( UEN ) .
Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the European Parliament , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , and Mr Markov , for his attention .
it is not a question of Article <unk> , because we are not in the field of social policy but , in fact , Article <unk> , which , in fact , is the subject of the Member States .
we have also witnessed events which have not only been <unk> , but also to <unk> <unk> , but also of <unk> <unk> between players themselves are the worst examples of the lack of education and culture that can be found in European <unk> .
the Commission , Mrs <unk> , is first of all to thank the <unk> , Mrs <unk> , for their <unk> , as well as the rapporteurs , Mrs <unk> , and Mrs <unk> for their excellent work .
( <unk> ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen , the failure of the objective of the Commission , as we are concerned , the failure to make the <unk> of women in the world .

<unk> to ships , there is still no <unk> in <unk> the number of the financial framework of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this <unk> was the first , in <unk> , in <unk> , where there has been more people in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Mr President , we must be restricted to the fact that the Member States have not the right to wait for the <unk> of <unk> .
an current study shows that the victims of these offences are the victims of these offences .
we support the need for strict financial discipline and a policy of growth , so that Greece can get the <unk> test of the profound and <unk> <unk> , so that Greece can get the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> economy , with the consequences of the <unk> and the Greek economy , a negative impact on Europe .
Madam President , Mr <unk> , ladies and gentlemen , the disparities between the poor regions and rich of the Community are really enormous .
the figures published by the condition of the <unk> <unk> Office ( the British <unk> <unk> <unk> ) <unk> the arguments which I have here today , in fact , is the case that the average level of life in the region of the peripheral and <unk> <unk> is less than 75 % of the EU &apos; s population .
it is also mentioned in the report and I believe that it is in the interests of consumers - as well as <unk> and <unk> .
the history <unk> for its <unk> against <unk> and secondly against the US embargo .
I am particularly pleased that the report states that the <unk> must take account of the social and economic characteristics of the countries in order to protect their economic sectors , such as agriculture and public services .
I welcome the support that Commissioner <unk> has expressed for the elimination of <unk> differences and I believe that there is a need to speed up the measures in the action plan in particular , in particular paragraph 2 , <unk> of the <unk> of employment .
it is the objective of the new regulation , which <unk> a directive and strengthening the conditions which the companies must meet .
I would like to say , I would like to say that I am not in the name of my Group of the Greens .
we are now told that a framework decision on the overall supervision is in project .
the problem is the same as far as nuclear waste is concerned and the rapid <unk> of nuclear waste in the next decades .
the adoption of this resolution cannot therefore only lead to the credibility of Parliament &apos; s Parliament , but it is still a danger to combating terrorism in general .
the amendments today are designed to recognise <unk> ( the new generation of the new generation for air traffic management as a Community body and to allow the status of the European Communities to be applied in its own staff .
Mr President , the next day will have to be seen in the United States .
( heckling from the right )
in this respect , pension services have a significant role to play in many Member States .
in this <unk> , since its long period of life can play a very serious role in terms of <unk> .
however , I would like to make sure that we do not stop here and that the process will go further .

they say that <unk> , the <unk> agreement , would be contrary to the American constitution .
in this case , the Commission has also a interest , but I would simply suggest that the way in which companies want to <unk> production at the request does not take account of the <unk> or <unk> of the Commission .
the presidency is aware of its proposals , and we are pleased that in a large extent , it is the case that I have mentioned it .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , when you said that the force of <unk> <unk> in Macedonia in <unk> <unk> , I have noted that you have not fully <unk> in this story .
( and <unk> ) The <unk> Sea is a transnational Sea and because of its former <unk> with the seas and <unk> , it is a very special area .
Mr President , the budget of the Committee on Budgetary Control has risen considerably at the time that its relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are developed .
the problem of health <unk> is not a new phenomenon , but there is a lot of mentioned in Europe and the USA .
<unk> of the European Union &apos; s solidarity : <unk> in <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> )
I believe that a defence policy for our Union is a <unk> approach , whose effects and <unk> of <unk> should not be <unk> .
<unk> a great deal of <unk> in the national <unk> and , of course , closely linked to the urban image and <unk> of Lisbon , there is more than two centuries , and there are two centuries , there is more than two centuries .
they are not in any way of doing any <unk> <unk> in all possible <unk> .
the enlargement of the Union &apos; s <unk> to two new countries , the current process of ratification of the Treaty and , above all , the entry into force of new financial perspectives must be replaced by effective application of the European Union &apos; s policies , and , in particular , the <unk> of the new financial perspectives .
however , it is even more worrying to hear as much fine , but to look at the international level at international level .
it applies to all the <unk> national and cross-border services allocated to the less <unk> <unk> .
Mr President , it is a motion for a point of order : tens of thousands of people throughout Europe and the free world , including the United States , including the United States , including the United States <unk> <unk> .
Parliament and the Council have immediately started discussions on the Commission proposals in a constructive spirit .
the Portuguese Presidency is aware of a political commitment of the part of the <unk> to take the form of improved <unk> , so that the Commission can be able to adopt an agreement , so that the Commission can be able to adopt the negotiations in order to achieve an agreement which is <unk> and balanced for both parts .
Mr President , on 30 June last , the <unk> of the European Central Bank has announced a <unk> to <unk> , namely the official of the European Central Bank .
are you not talking about the question of a new threat , a threat of a new type of proof ?
it will contribute significantly to prevention and reducing the harmful effects of the <unk> on the environment and human health .
it is therefore only time for a time to take a period of the limit values for the effect that they are , and not only the <unk> effects .
in writing , in writing , ( <unk> ) The <unk> report deals with the Chinese coast of the sea .
<unk> is <unk> because the Israeli and Palestinian leaders decided together with the <unk> ...
<unk> experience , experience and lessons in this <unk> II programme are active by the Commission in the context of a review of its overall strategy in this area .
it is <unk> to see today that our position , if our rapporteur , Mr <unk> <unk> , is in the process of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the Committee on Fisheries , <unk> <unk> , is the case of saying .
I would like to endorse this .
on behalf of the Confederal Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , without effective coordination of economic policies , economic union and monetary union is <unk> at failure .
the situation of human rights in <unk> , including the freedom of the press , will continue to be the subject of the Commission as a basis of the Commission as a basis of the continuing review of bilateral cooperation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to congratulate Mr <unk> on his report and its contribution during the second reading in Parliament .
the provisions relating to the status of officials are that there are categories of former officials who have the <unk> of the institution to do so in other sensitive areas , but there is not currently members of <unk> members .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission , Madam President , for his excellent report .

after the last actions of the last legal actions against India in India , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Turkey , I would like to <unk> once again against the continuation of these <unk> <unk> , particularly by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with our <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in view of strengthening consumer confidence , is taking account of the concerns that these <unk> are to be taken into consideration , but also to <unk> <unk> , but also to control <unk> , but also to control them , is legitimate .
its real impact , however , will depend on the determination of each person to comply with the highest rules .
it is quite the case of what the courage could achieve .
consequently , the transitional rules have enabled us to control the flow of workers from the <unk> of <unk> Europe in order to concentrate on the actions of the <unk> <unk> in order to concentrate on the provisions of the <unk> and working conditions .
these organisations should be able to respond to the needs of the people and they subsequently <unk> by inertia .
do you want to take the model to you for Europe ?
the <unk> strategy for the sea , which we are currently preparing to prepare , is a good example of what we are trying to see .
in conclusion , there is another form of sovereignty that we must defend : our right to decide in our past and to assess .
<unk> , we give them the main right to ask ourselves to proceed with us a direct agreement , with the <unk> of the authorities of <unk> , even if Canada does not wish to reach an agreement with the European Union .
our requirements on access to information and transparency in each simplified procedure would be <unk> , despite the major efforts made by the Conciliation Committee , to be able to speak against the text of compromise .
this is an issue which also concerns promotion of human rights .
in fact , despite the fact that the period of double movement has been <unk> up until the end of the year , I can tell you that after two weeks , almost all transactions are already carried out in euros .
the Community is in its entirety as a whole of globalisation , but problems may have a negative effect at local level .
in the context of the economic crisis and &quot; Europe &quot; <unk> &quot; , European environmental policy is a major importance , and the assessment of this policy cannot be seriously <unk> .
we need to create conditions on the labour market which allow men and women to participate in this .
I look forward to the continuation of our constructive cooperation with the Community to continue to play a key role in the protection of the <unk> <unk> .
such an <unk> for the <unk> would also be an important contribution to the problems of the safety of the <unk> and the <unk> region in particular .
the Council is also <unk> , first of all , not to listen to the debate , but also to vote , because it is more <unk> by purely national interests than a European policy of agriculture .
( de ) Madam President , Madam President , the problems of the rule of law in Russia are not <unk> , but a <unk> which is going to be systematic .
the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted a very clear position on this .
the <unk> of 25 December has shown that it is not the data that is being done , but the ability to use the data we already have .
in the case of this case , I will not be able to be able to support this report .
in this case , we know that the danger of the risk of the population is the result of the population .
