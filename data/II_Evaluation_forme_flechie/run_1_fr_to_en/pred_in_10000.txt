Mr <unk> has the floor for a point of order .
in its conclusion , the <unk> Council is calling for a reform of the <unk> system after May 1998 .
<unk> , to conclude , I would like to see a <unk> report , which must try to <unk> the <unk> of ambitious <unk> in this budget , but I believe it will be difficult to find a <unk> policy by the Europeans in a budget financial framework .
I hope that young people will not have to <unk> the European Parliament or give us the silence , but that we can defend our values and democracy .
we hope here with new <unk> , which will allow us to obtain a few progress , if we are <unk> enough .
however , they do nothing to do with them .
let us remember that the <unk> level of this man is <unk> , in other words , a <unk> level .
there was a great deal .
what is the timetable on these proposals ?
the importance of <unk> <unk> in <unk> goes much beyond local or national levels .
I hope that we will be able to present practical proposals .
however , the Presidency is convinced that this approach is the most realistic basis of <unk> for an agreement at the end that everyone has the will to get a sufficient political will .
the Commission and the Council have held meetings with the <unk> <unk> , Mr <unk> , and the Minister .
as a result , the European Union and the European Community <unk> their commitment in relation to the Kyoto Protocol and <unk> their commitment to setting up the necessary changes to change .
this Treaty will create more transparency and democracy and strengthen the EU &apos; s action functions to fulfil its functions more effectively .
the vote must take place in principle , otherwise it will take place this evening .
on the basis of this , the Commission will be if the <unk> of membership of <unk> will be maintained .
however , we believe it is essential that negotiations which start , which may be difficult and long , are <unk> in certain main areas on Community level .
for example , the idea of setting up experts for exchanging best practice and <unk> <unk> has received considerable support in public consultation .
the present proposal is one of the <unk> <unk> , namely that it will be up until 30 June of the aid system .
on behalf of the <unk> Group , Madam President , the <unk> Research Programme is the most important Programme for research in the world : <unk> EUR <unk> million for this period and more than nine thousand projects financed here .
I am part of <unk> this morning .
because of the <unk> economic situation ( <unk> % of 80 % and an inflation rate of more than 1 % of 1 % , public opinion is becoming increasingly <unk> against it .
that is not what we have done with the proposed amendments .
let us allow these EUR <unk> to this Treaty .
I hope it will include the situation in which I find it .
it must therefore be necessary to be <unk> in the process of the Geneva process and in terms of stabilisation operations in this country .
why does this mean that most of these women have the most need for a stable and <unk> relationship in their life ?
however , border controls will only be <unk> by the Union when the EU will be able to ensure that the candidate country can fully ensure that the EU can fully ensure that the acquis communautaire is applied in this area .
indeed , I had exactly seen this same task of looking at these seven years ago , and then I discovered , ladies and gentlemen , of the most <unk> practices in the Committee on Budgets .
this is why it is necessary to take a similar view in the committee &apos; s report on the state of affairs of <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we therefore withdraw the proposal put forward in Amendment No 10 because we have achieved this vote in exactly what we wanted .
the drafting of this report is , in itself , an indication of the importance of this issue and the text included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , because it has led to various committees .
the second point concerns compensation of emissions or exchanges of rights .
whatever it is , I believe that it is necessary to take account of the previous <unk> in the other decisions being used by the Member State in which the process has been initiated .
in writing , I voted against this resolution because the objective of full employment is <unk> .
it would therefore be unfair to call on the <unk> document , but it is true that this criticism would be justified if we were faced with a document by the Commission .
we must choose a different way .
although the reality of economic , <unk> policy must be established .
indeed , if Mr <unk> &apos; s first report has never been presented during the previous parliamentary parliamentary term , then we could have had a step forward .
when is Russia supposed to deny human rights <unk> ?
Mr President , you have rightly stated that only some languages are affected .
the presence and cooperation of representatives of the Commission to the conciliation has promoted Parliament .
they want to see action after 2003 , not just of more .
furthermore , concerns are still about <unk> conflicts and a lack of transparency .
this is the case , for example , of the amendment to the need for a proper selection of waste and then only for the granting of the discharge , and then that is the selection of <unk> waste .
you have seen what happened all the day with the agenda and is not satisfactory .
a emergency aid which <unk> too late the image of the Union &apos; s efficiency and <unk> of European solidarity .
I should also like to <unk> with the greatest force against this <unk> expressed in the Security Council which , not just <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the mandate caused by the United Nations , but also <unk> for foreign and other countries which <unk> in the <unk> .
the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment and Social Affairs is now in favour of maintaining the definition of the <unk> <unk> .
this area must be <unk> on the basis of a few <unk> , very few European political projects , but projects are <unk> , but <unk> projects which deal with real problems which we face , first and foremost , which deals with real problems which we have face .
that is why I consider it very important .
if we want to reduce the food <unk> and pollution pollution , we must give them the <unk> which will adopt this approach .
( <unk> ) Madam President , we have to make a scandal , but this is not enough enough .
a reduction in the European Council is necessary , according to the European Council &apos; s <unk> , and it is necessary to protect the <unk> , whereas that is a political decision .
despite these <unk> , the project is worthy of support and the European <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in writing , <unk> report has a duty to demand for Member States .
it would be a sign of the international community in the conflict for <unk> .
I would like to support the proposal , but I cannot help to prevent a brief comment in conclusion : that of Parliament &apos; s life would certainly be better and more democratic .
we are perfectly aware , as the Presidency of the fact that we are almost at the <unk> date of 2010 , which is at stake in 2000 .
indeed , in fact , it does not seem to have a <unk> effect on nuclear energy , but it does not seem to have a further impact on the <unk> of <unk> and security regulations which must be dealt with by <unk> .
<unk> , I also believe that a system of <unk> , which has also been proposed , is very likely to provide information that consumers can be able to make good choice .
however , our objective is to implement this improvement , and this will also take part in training .
we should not go back to our promise for the CAP before <unk> , as well as we have said <unk> .
I said at the time that I was absolutely not prepared to see what I have seen in our visit .
it can help to help peace and to consolidate democratic democratic , but it will only do so if it takes account of the enormous complexity of this region , if it takes account of its strategy .
will you give us the assurance that the <unk> payment payments , which are going to be presented by using <unk> and which , we know , will have a shared environmental component of <unk> ?
it is also necessary to ensure that , in other words , we also need to ensure that the national legislation is implemented effectively in order to provide a stable base for security , it is also necessary to ensure that the national authorities are working effectively in order to ensure that all the citizens of the European Union are able to benefit from this security of security .
the Stability and <unk> Stability Pact makes it possible to <unk> <unk> which does not , to prevent , prevent the monetary policy , which is , of course , far too <unk> .
<unk> to third-country nationals of third country nationals in <unk> <unk> ( the debate )
moreover , I should like to stress that this is expressly included in the new agreement which has supported both parties , the European Union and the United States .
the advantages she has in the field of <unk> are so many <unk> .
( FR ) I have received a letter from the <unk> of Question Time today as a matter of urgency : &quot; your question is one of the first questions to the Commission .
ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , after an hour of the electoral strategy of the Lisbon strategy , it is not necessary to stress the need for a <unk> of research and innovation in the European Union .
- ( FR ) I agree with the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the Council on the treatment of minorities in the regions that you have just mentioned and <unk> a kind of comparison with the protection of minorities .
with regard to Mr Mulder &apos; s remark , you stated that , given that , since the budget is experienced in agricultural policy , the risk of a <unk> on the <unk> market should be <unk> as well as possible , because this could prove to be desirable if the euro / <unk> / <unk> report is <unk> .
Commissioner , Commissioner , it is the right way to ensure that it is <unk> and to present the desired date of <unk> that you have set up the other regulations on prevention .
<unk> is part of a commitment made by the Commission during the Brussels conference in April .
as we pointed out in several times , this is a demand thanks to the workers and the citizens of the most <unk> countries , that these workers are <unk> and that their quality of life is <unk> .
we are working on a new proposal for a directive on the security of supply in gas and the project will be presented in the next few weeks , at the beginning of a study study which is already under way .
unfortunately , I cannot accept the same hope as regards the President of the Fund and the secretariat .
at the beginning of the outset , the <unk> should be banned .
we face a <unk> crisis which neither Parliament nor the European Union cannot ignore .
it must work 12 hours at a later date .
it is also used in the steel .
although a <unk> dialogue and honest dialogue between partners should be a clear point of view that the <unk> Austrian Austrian <unk> in Palestine was <unk> by saying that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
in this context , the strategic guidelines which we are debating today are important , because they relate precisely to the content of cohesion policy : where will be <unk> and what will be the priority sectors .
for example , in the digital environment .
the Commission has tabled <unk> proposals to reinforce parliamentary scrutiny and suggested other compromise solutions , but they have not been followed by Parliament and the Council .
I believe that we are right to do so because , when we look at the debate as a result of the debate , there is clearly a legal <unk> which we have to give for vigilance .
I am pleased about this statement , as the first <unk> Prime Minister said for the first time that for the first time , a demand for combating terrorism has been made as clear and precise to Arafat .
we cannot have more security in Europe with less <unk> money .
in the meantime , we have to increase the proportion of European energy <unk> by nuclear energy .
so how can we deal with this ?
the absence of a legal basis which would <unk> this operational sector and the <unk> of the area of decisions in unanimity to the Council will have <unk> to this sector , which is at present being taken into a <unk> between large <unk> and that goes at any rate at any rate .
the second task is to ask all your fellow delegates to ask their information services for companies to provide their information with SMEs , as they all have to be involved in relations with SMEs in their own language .
I voted for the report on the report on the European Parliament &apos; s report and of the Council &apos; s initial obligations , whose objective is to reduce excessive administrative constraints on certain forms of companies .
at the same time , there has been no less <unk> in the <unk> of the countries of the <unk> countries since <unk> , which has not prevented Europe &apos; s <unk> .
I am pleased to be able to discuss you with you , in future , of the reform of the <unk> sector which I will be presenting in the Council , as I am happy to see that , in the European Parliament , I am right to present this basis of our future discussions .
I am also pleased to welcome a delegation of the Community of the Committee on Economic Affairs of the European Union of Africa for South Africa ( <unk> ) of 15 Member States of South Africa and additional competence .
these agreements , including those from these six countries , have said that , and <unk> those of the European Union , will be in the future of the <unk> of short-term <unk> of <unk> , at least some of them , because , in other cases , they are excluded from a <unk> or <unk> activity , as is forced to do so .
the package of &quot; <unk> &quot; which the Commission adopted last week is a number of principles which will be applied in political and legislative proposals .
for an effective <unk> policy for human rights , it is essential that the Member States of the European Union <unk> in <unk> a common policy , coherent and visible policy in bilateral relations with those countries which do not comply with human rights .
I therefore reject Amendment No 17 .
I clearly say that the question of how we should call this institution a day or the other , is not an essential one in my view .
however , consultation also means granted .
<unk> , the <unk> of the planet must be guaranteed in the period , to study its <unk> <unk> , and particularly those involved by human <unk> .
this is still far from being the case .
I am thinking in particular of Romania , Bulgaria , but I would add them to the Balkans .
it is obvious that the peace process will continue more <unk> and fully if the European Union does not want to do so .
if we have clear objectives in favour of the environment and the health , and that we have to <unk> to <unk> society , NGOs and politicians - without forget good lawyers - then we can reach these objectives .
it is thanks to an external pressure , in the event your decision , Mr President , to <unk> two hundred budget lines , that the Council has made it no longer possible to postpone this matter .
faced with this results , we are all at the same time asking for the efforts made in order to create a policy of cohesion .
this is why it is very important for us to pay special attention to innovation .
why , for example , is this Parliament &apos; s <unk> in any event is <unk> to emissions of <unk> ?
it is in the context of the overall <unk> strategy of the EU in the world .
our duty , however , should be <unk> <unk> , with a legislative production which the citizens of Europe should perhaps be able to consider during the next few months .
they need a direct advantage of the <unk> <unk> .
these <unk> asylum , which I would prefer to call for , should be <unk> in their region .
even more explicit , if we want adequate security , we must not only provide guarantees for fundamental rights of citizens , but we must also develop the European justice <unk> .
he said not only to create cross-border areas but also the <unk> of large regions of Russia .
Mr President , Commissioner , if we , in Europe , we would have had to act , and we should have been able to act as a result of <unk> , and give us a technical support for Asia , I would like to have a technical support to deal with the problem which we have already returned to some of the <unk> of meat .
I very much hope that the <unk> of this indirect crime will be <unk> and deserves justice .
however , however , the report recognises the need for an independent , scientific and rigorous study of the conventions of the US on drugs , to <unk> and complement them .
consequently , at this stage , the Commission cannot accept amendments which refer to financial aid , since the budgetary allocation must be included .
when I attended my report by writing in July , I am told that this original proposal was not good .
the general spirit of the report and the motion for a resolution presented a rather critical note .
the right to access to information in environmental matters is not just a right but also a question of power .
it is therefore necessary , therefore , that the <unk> authorities will be <unk> on education .
we support the proposal for all the European Commission as a result of all the same technical , as a result of which , for each initiative , the text can be available in its entirety , even if , for each initiative , it will be possible to make use of <unk> and transparency of Community legislation .
a <unk> of <unk> <unk> on the Internet must be implemented in order to <unk> their <unk> by Europol .
I hope that this <unk> is wrong and that the honourable Members will have the pleasure to work with him .
therefore , these conventions must be <unk> and implemented in the world so that all the providers can join .
this means , for example , the consolidation of public finances .
annual debate on progress made in the <unk> of freedom , security and justice ( 2 and 39 ) ( voting ) ( voting and 39 ) ( vote )
we have three years and , in my view , we are all involved .
on the contrary , they give them more effective and <unk> legal cooperation in the hands of judges , not by governments , and not governments , at the European Union .
they paid their life as the irresponsibility of those who <unk> for the right of <unk> to life .
<unk> efforts to be <unk> with the <unk> objectives of the EU .
and then , in these proposals , we have no positive proposal as the <unk> report for order to allow a genuine economic administration in the European Union .
thank you very much , Commissioner <unk> .
on the basis of this latter , I am interested on the <unk> nature of some groups , as well as this committee has not a <unk> <unk> but a role of initiative .
I am pleased about this debate .
in category 3 , you laid down an increase in the allocation of trans-European networks , which goes beyond the result achieved by the European Parliament and the Council for conciliation .
there is a serious threat to a <unk> reduction in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> to the markets a wrong and dangerous signal to suggest that the <unk> adoption of necessary measures should become <unk> .
that is why I <unk> the events which have led some of the ideas made by colleagues to express criticism and their <unk> on the issue of <unk> .
as far as the construction sector is concerned , the directives are <unk> .
in <unk> , I too would like to congratulate Mr Markov and everyone who wishes for a <unk> and <unk> year in innovation .
this should continue to continue .
I hope that the United States will have a <unk> of energy - and I would prefer to hear the current <unk> of the current conflict in <unk> .
we should support public services in these countries and at least provide education to children .
I would therefore say that this Treaty will assist Europe &apos; s legislation in becoming more social , on the basis of the objectives which you agreed with in the summit .
<unk> is full !
it seems to me that only a few objectives have been achieved .
if you tell the governments that they have to carry out economies and reduce their <unk> when <unk> is a result of <unk> , I do not believe that they will have to do so , but I do not believe that they want to comply with their electoral promises when the financial situation is needed .
on the part of <unk> , it is a particularly important matter for <unk> Austria .
( <unk> ) Madam President , Madam President , I understand that the <unk> quotas must be higher and I am in favour of this .
- <unk> Barak !
preparations are under way in these three areas .
the installations where nuclear waste are <unk> , and the levels of <unk> are high .
as far as fisheries agreements are concerned , the new evaluation has led the Commission to give its support to both aspects of the <unk> budget if the budgetary authority can agree to these changes .
I think he has highlighted relevant points in this report and in the <unk> resolution .
thanks to the detailed pressure of its principal trading partner , the EU should be encouraged to act more closely on compliance with compliance with respect and respect for human rights and human rights .
that brings me to my last point .
I voted against the compromise resolution on <unk> because it <unk> a <unk> by the Parliament on 30 January last year .
but the problem of access to the European labour market is still more than 100 million citizens .
how can we define this ambition if we undermine the common agricultural policy ?
the proposal seeks to <unk> Directive 95 / 70 / EC of the Council of 22 December 1995 of the Council of 22 December 1995 .
<unk> , Mr President , I am entirely prepared to cooperate with the Council .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I should like to pay tribute to my colleague , Mr Tsatsos , not just for the serious <unk> he has drawn up his report , but at least as much as possible with which he has <unk> his report .
that is what we have achieved , as you know .
the resolution on political options is a fundamental right , but today the right of this law is extremely difficult .
the worst thing we can do was to postpone your <unk> from a minute &apos; s speech , but I cannot accept it !
a year ago , we have dealt with the <unk> report on the <unk> and <unk> content of the Internet .
I hope that the presidency will ensure that the measures which allow them to <unk> will be implemented , and in time , to ensure that it is necessary to do so .
in other words , we should not be <unk> to certain values .
in writing - ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) , I voted for the <unk> report on the European Parliament &apos; s report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Security Council .
the <unk> of this resignation are the following :
this is particularly the case of inflation .
given that , the Commission is committed to include these amendments in the work which will be carried out within the framework of the programme .
in March 2006 , we have drawn up the <unk> <unk> in relation to the autumn <unk> .
in fact , the latest meetings of the IGC have shown that a number of national delegations start to be raised .
I am saying this with all I have for a country which has voted &quot; no &quot; .
while the rapporteur , I would also like to ask , as such , for all the time being a reality , that the Commission and the <unk> are all the members of the Member States of the Member States on the fact that they should not do this as a mere technical step .
in writing - ( <unk> ) I would like to congratulate Mr <unk> <unk> for his report which highlights the difficulties affecting women in rural areas , that is on the labour market or on other aspects of their life .
I shall put the request for the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
and I would like you once again to see that we are not able to have <unk> or far too <unk> in relation to the opening of negotiations and therefore , for your statement .
the new round of negotiations on liberalisation and the establishment of the world &apos; s rules on the <unk> of world trade is something which we want to establish , if we want to establish sustainable economic growth , if we want to develop a sustainable economic growth , if we want to create a <unk> increase in <unk> and to ensure that there is a proper distribution of profits in <unk> .
we cannot , as Europeans , remain firmly before what is happening in <unk> and before the human rights abuses .
moreover , we must consider the effects of the proposal on small and medium-sized companies .
this needs to be even greater in the future because women , which were <unk> in a form of these treatment , are now being held on the labour market and should be increasingly implemented .
Madam President , in an increasingly difficult context of migration management and fight against illegal immigration , it is very difficult to accept this Spanish initiative , both on the basis and form .
as the Prime Minister of Portugal has said , Mr Da , Mr Da , was thus <unk> towards a more open , more <unk> and fair society .
let us consider the spirit in which we have made our support for this proposal , by asking that it makes life easier for our fellow citizens , but that that does not lead to <unk> , but that that does not lead to <unk> .
I believe it is necessary to take account and inform Parliament as it must , and to speed up the <unk> of justice and internal affairs .
having said that , the vast <unk> will obviously be mainly based on regional policy .
the EU must show that it recognises the situation .
we supported the democrats and supported all those who want to take the path of the European Union .
I personally agree with the negotiations of the peace process , I can only welcome the efforts made by Parliament to ensure political impetus of this programme .
all this is included in the new criminal penal code .
the powers which you are proposing to Brussels are : the management and definition of minimum social protection , the flexibility of working hours , thus the distribution of working time , as well as <unk> on social dialogue as <unk> in France .
but terrorism must be <unk> to its political <unk> , economic and social , and security must not be a sign for not to continue the peace process .
this is a matter of urgency .
the general conclusion of the whole issue , Commissioner , is that , Commissioner , we must start by a large <unk> of the Commission &apos; s internal organisation , a processing which all these facts have shown .
<unk> <unk> have been called for EUR <unk> 000 in the postal service , <unk> and <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
( the President cut the speaker off )
these are shortcomings which must be <unk> <unk> .
as far as reducing damage is concerned , I would like to say that I am not opposed to this , even if I want to see that the idea of the report is <unk> .
we must make more pressure on those who promised their aid for them , as well as on <unk> <unk> by <unk> and the United Nations for their <unk> .
this is a fundamental political issue which we must respond to , as soon as the Council will soon .
I am referring to other speakers in their positive reply to the <unk> work made by Mr <unk> and Mr <unk> excellent work by Mr <unk> .
the solution for the future is to invest in renewable energy sources and their development .
it is the <unk> <unk> of my colleagues who worked with the Italian Presidency and the Commission that we have succeeded in an agreement .
has this been respected ?
we cannot simply draw attention to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and then ignore the violations who take place in our own countries .
in this Parliament we will not <unk> the search for a peaceful solution to a problem which can only be resolved as a peaceful and political way .
for expenditure , allow me to remind you very much of the need for solidarity which must remain one of the <unk> of the Union .
sometimes , it <unk> the need for a minimum and , sometimes , the possibility of drawing up a simple recommendation to Member States .
I am pleased that the next &apos; Foreign Affairs Council will have a lot of <unk> , and I will end , Mr President , that the forthcoming European Council of 14 February will take its opinion on these serious events , as President <unk> , for example .
it must allow regions , to their diversity , to monitor their changes and prepare for the future <unk> in the best possible conditions , and thus <unk> access to <unk> .
the <unk> areas are crucial to prevent a <unk> disaster .
I hope we can have better <unk> on the issue for 2010 .
is it possible to consider a more balanced structure in <unk> and in the region ?
these days , this subject has been a controversial <unk> , particularly by the remarks published in the newspaper .
the increase in raw materials , energy and food products still have this risk for the most vulnerable groups .
the debate is closed .
everyone rightly stated that the UN &apos; s <unk> and the implementation of Russia have been of shortcomings and that we must try to make use of <unk> in the game .
( <unk> ) Mr President , I would particularly like to draw attention to Mrs <unk> &apos; s report .
but according to your national <unk> and , above all , social , <unk> , the free movement of people .
however , I should like to stress that no fraud or <unk> have been <unk> .
<unk> principles of the Union and the <unk> <unk> are used to safeguard the interests of <unk> countries .
I support the Council &apos; s position and the President of the ECB , Mr <unk> , expressed in his remarks .
as far as <unk> , it is necessary to say that they are one of the most possible ways of preventing that the epidemic is <unk> .
the current events are <unk> of serious and real positions of Member States , particularly the euro states .
the Commission has proposed EUR 1 <unk> for this year .
the <unk> of the conflict must directly address issues such as the right to return of the Palestinians , Jerusalem or <unk> of <unk> , the problem of the <unk> policy and also the legitimate demand of the <unk> people .
<unk> , the agreements between Member States - concerning types of treatment and the scope and scope of services which will be available to people - also to clarify the situation of many people .
it is impossible to prevent the <unk> when you ask you to give you informed of <unk> .
I do not want to remind you all the terrorist attacks who took place on the European ground over the last decade .
if we do not find a constructive solution to this crisis , and a peaceful solution , I am afraid that our debate on globalisation and attempts to find constructive solutions to a series of issues are a step forward .
Europe has agreed on the conditions for setting up a single system for <unk> workers .
this decision must be applied for a period of ten years .
firstly , the growth .
this development cannot be <unk> by a legislative <unk> in this area .
the first concerns the <unk> efforts of Member States to identify irregularities and physical <unk> on Community funds , although , unfortunately , there are some old Member States which are <unk> on cases of fraud than on fraud .
the <unk> regulations must be <unk> effectively by the start .
indeed , one of the grounds of the burden of relations between Parliament and the Commission has not been <unk> by some Commissioners .
there is also a proposed amendment : the consumers are in the right to know whether a product is a basis for <unk> of animal origin , and they should not want to go further : the manufacturer must be <unk> if products of origin of origin of animal feed .
however , we have chosen to abstain from the final vote because we do not believe that this is a good idea than a good idea of the fact that the other countries do not have to do likewise .
the 500 000 students , the 30 000 tonnes of language and the many <unk> have had to use this programme with success , given that additional resources should be granted to this programme .
it is therefore essential to continue their proposals to ensure that they can develop and ensure their position on the market , and ensure that the single market needs access to funding and potential benefits of the single market .
the last thing they need , is that a lasting disaster - the EU is still going to create a permanent disaster .
in this respect , coordination at European level will be crucial and will make the harmful effects .
once again , Parliament has shown flexibility at the negotiations , but not to <unk> its political priorities .
it is <unk> that a poor country is <unk> in the situation of <unk> money in Brussels , but it is also quite absurd that the case has <unk> too long .
<unk> , Madam President , I should like to point out that this year is far from being the Commission &apos; s programme , and the Commission should be <unk> by the Commission .
if you do not have your mistakes , you are sentenced to them .
it is not the time to condemn some of the people who produce drugs and <unk> others .
this is , of course , a question which remains <unk> .
Mr <unk> , you again have the floor .
the debate is closed .
I should , however , like to point out that the European Parliament has been <unk> for many years of very close relations with the parliamentary leaders of Latin America , the rest of the most old , the most old and the most old European Parliament with other members of Latin America .
civil society is in a <unk> state .
in order to come from this problem and improve coordination , of my own Directorate-General , the services of my own Directorate-General and the relevant <unk> , of my own Directorate-General , have created an <unk> working party .
is it very clear that <unk> <unk> for EUR 300 million can only create a <unk> <unk> , because that could be followed by <unk> <unk> .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr <unk> and the Council of the Council of Human Rights .
it is possible to build such a lot of good <unk> , and I therefore believe that a <unk> partnership is a third option between the Member States and those who have a <unk> relationship with the European Union , and that they should also have to pay attention to the future .
it makes it clear that far from what we are talking about , there is also a lot of things and it is <unk> mainly : it is more easy for Europe to have major ambitions than all .
I have the impression that this was mainly the case in the Council where , in my opinion , there is a <unk> fear of competition , but also the success of the <unk> .
however , we must say that the decision taken at the beginning of this month will not <unk> the <unk> of the trans-European networks .
you will have the report as well as the end of this year .
this is certainly not the best way to do so .
after all , it is precisely what most of the citizens of my country and the rest of Europe .
my desire and conviction are that this British policy too <unk> as far as possible .
( the sitting was closed at <unk> p.m. )
there are no more than 17 days before the Union .
it is a matter of urgency that the euro is being carried out , which is a <unk> and <unk> factor between Member States .
Mr President , allow me to reply to some of our fellow Member &apos; s comments .
what are the points I find about ?
<unk> , the appropriations granted to defence are at risk at the expense of the UK .
that is something we must know about .
the final draft agenda , as has been established by the <unk> Conference during the session of 15 May 1996 in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , was distributed .
