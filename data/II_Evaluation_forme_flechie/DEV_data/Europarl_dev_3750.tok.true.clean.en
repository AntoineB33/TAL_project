it was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density .
Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of &apos; economic and social cohesion &apos; rather than &apos; regional development &apos; as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area .
Amendment No 11 replaces &apos; government or municipal officials &apos; with &apos; government officials &apos; .
although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors of the territory concerned , government officials must be involved at decision-making level , whether they come from the municipalities , departments , regions or national governments .
the rapporteur &apos; s phrasing was therefore too limiting .
Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism of this House .
it specifies the necessary coordination between LEADER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTERREG , PHARE , Sapard or MEDA .
in the territory of Member States of the European Union , applicant countries or Member States of EFTA , there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives .
the real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur .
the creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union , provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners .
in essence , we are , of course , in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative .
the conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union &apos; s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric , including infrastructure , public and private services and so on .
in this context , in committee we regretted the paltry funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LEADER I and LEADER II initiatives .
the budget allocated to LEADER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LEADER II for a period of six years .
this is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements .
finally , among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement , particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by LAGs within the LEADER II initiative , but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified .

additives in feedingstuffs
the next item is the report ( A5-0015 / 2000 ) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70 / 524 / EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs ( COM ( 1999 ) 388 - C5-0134 / 1999 - 1999 / 0168 ( CNS ) ) .
Mr President , Commissioner Byrne , under Directive 70 / 524 , high-technology additives are treated differently , depending on the date of authorisation .
the Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now .
as far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned , so far so good .
however , the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics , drugs , growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms .
that makes it a question of health , not just approximating laws , which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152 , that is to say with codecision by Parliament .
we asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , which pointed out that , as far as approximating laws is concerned , Article 37 is adequate in this case .
however , we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws ; because this proposal also encompasses genetically-modified organisms , we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health .
we negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically-modified organisms in the directive , taking the text on which Directive 70 / 524 is based as a starting point .
Mr Byrne , we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work .
we have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text .
moreover , this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well .
the Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future .
however , that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives .
we are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms .
we therefore assume , Commissioner Byrne , that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base .
in other words , we do not need to re-negotiate the text ; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive .
I can hardly wait , Commissioner Byrne , to hear what you have to say to our proposals .
Mr President , Commissioner , does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy ?
as far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned , it comes under competition .
of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988 .
we want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle &apos; s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support .
however , as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report , this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter .
food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions .
when we talk of transparency in the food chain , that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs .
the antibiotics , growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain .
the dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction .
according to Article 152 of the EC Treaty , we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health , whereby the accent is clearly on sources .
consequently , we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger , i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs .
otherwise , in my view , we are beavering away at the symptoms , but not the causes .
people are especially wary of GMOs .
we must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly .
first , if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms , then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment .
secondly , it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation , as the rapporteur has said .
and thirdly , if we are to have a transparent consumer policy , we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs .
a clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice , both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer .
responsible citizens should , in my view , have a choice .
we all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety .
by regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently , we can help significantly to restore confidence .
I too , therefore , can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments .
consequently , we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be .
Mr President , this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs .
in other words , we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months .
that this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin , antibiotic , sludge and other scandals have attracted .
in other words , this is an important facet of public health protection , which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base , not Article 37 , as proposed by the Commission .
the amendment which the Commission has proposed , namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987 , is uncontested and has our full support .
however , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal .
the regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives .
only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded .
this sort of monopoly , which could lead , for example , to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs , should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998 .
this would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed .
the most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion , as recommended by the rapporteur , of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives , taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point .
this already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs .
it is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case , just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas , such as forest reproductive material , to mention just one example .
the labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect .
on the one hand , it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and , on the other hand , it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs .
finally , our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur , who has gone to a great deal of trouble .
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne &apos; s reply .
Mr President , the report deals mainly with formalities , in other words , the manner in which additives will be authorised . it is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work .
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that , in future , all the directives are dealt with under Article 152 , since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview .
we cannot carry on as we have done up until now , that is to say dealing with each detail on its own , often only after the harm has already been done .
the rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives .
however , I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics .
certainly , five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned .
it is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four , both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves .
we now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people &apos;s health , particularly in the case of small children .
a number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary .
several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same .
we talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but , in the case of antibiotics , it has long since been forgotten .
however , there is another environmental principle at stake , namely the exchange principle .
I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats .
they are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary .
there is a substitute , which is used to vaccinate chickens .
although it is a little more expensive , it does not harm the environment .
coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields .
in that way , they end up in our water supplies which , as we all know , are our most vital resource .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives .
yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition .
you may recall , even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public , that the Commission &apos; s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil .
we must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals .
Incidentally , it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs , cats and other domestic animals .
is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry ?
such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate , even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters .
the precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates .
as forcefully underlined by this report , labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock .
he must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health .
in any case , the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing .
however , before labelling we need clear rules .
straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal , for example .
although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms , it is their use which must be questioned today .
in this respect , the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions .
the Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined .
this is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and , to do this , the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time .
this is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure .
also , Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such , thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions .
Mr President , because of the availability of high-technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry , detailed information on their use is needed from the actors , and as we know there are a lot of them , so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe Community law .
this directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own .
other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them .
up the point at which meat , milk , bread and other products are sold over the shop counter , feedingstuffs and additives are structured , mixed , blended , cut and transported several times .
the fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems , just as it does in the foodstuffs industry .
the negative consequences are well known , the positive ones less so .
I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region .
however , more work is needed on this .
Mr President , may I commence by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on his report .
it reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality .
the events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health .
the swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future , for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform .
but even in this crucial area of administration , Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility .
in Agenda 2000 , we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens : food safety , water quality , environmental protection and rural development .
if we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence , the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs .
I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds .
those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely .
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety , Mr Byrne .
he has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House , as well as to the concern of consumers .
I am particularly pleased that my own country , Ireland , is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability .
this will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work . I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group .
it is therefore specified that , through the adoption of a regulation , the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation . this will occur at the same time for all the additives in question .
a coherent legal framework must be re-established .
as of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70 / 524 / EEC for the replacement of the authorisations .
however , we must ensure that competition distortions are not created , as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi .
genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this .
the consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision .
this proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget .
there must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety .
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which , as you know , was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Mr President , we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection .
we therefore welcome the Commission &apos; s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs .
the Committee on behalf of which I am speaking , namely the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , decided in December , on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report , that we could waive our opinion .
nevertheless , I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points .
first , perhaps , I should say something on the question of the legal base .
therefore , and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne , I reject your choice of legal basis .
if it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives , then it is a mistake to keep it .
my group , as Mr Kindermann has already said , will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise .
Mr Byrne , I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation .
if we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee , we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation .
the Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37 .
allow me to comment briefly on two other points . first , genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs .
we cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law .
we do not have another law at the moment , and until we do , we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation ; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled .
the rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign .
I say now , as I have said on numerous occasions in the past : yes , I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House , but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs .
it is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States .
there are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
this is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future .
what has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers .
we must strike a balance between them .
we must resolve this issue , because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat .
one way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned .
GMOs are the new challenge facing us .
this is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so : I myself share these concerns .
but I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed .
indeed , we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe .
one factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food .
these are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field : food must be of the same standard in all Member States .
we have had the dioxin scare , BSE and many other problems .
the main problem is a financial one , namely who bears the cost ?
the problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer : the producer has been forced to bear all the cost .
we need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred .
we must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union .
if we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future .
. I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur , the committee chairman , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , for examining the Commission &apos;s proposal .
the Commission proposal is , as some of you have said , rather technical .
nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective : to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives .
at present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations , depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988 .
the purpose of the Commission &apos;s proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists .
the scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited .
five amendments have been presented by Parliament .
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments , despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament , the Agricultural Committee and , in particular , the rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on these issues .
I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately .
the first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152 .
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection .
the proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health .
I note that Parliament &apos;s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base .
I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health .
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position , in my view , with precision , clarity and commendable brevity .
amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives .
I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue .
I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary .
however , this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives .
the Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70 / 524 on genetically modified additives at this stage .
instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90 / 220 , which is currently in second reading in Parliament .
the Commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments .
I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provisions of Directive 90 / 220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of Directive 70 / 524 that the Commission has proposed in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July 2001 .
I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account .
amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted .
the Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations .
I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues .
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate .
first of all , regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70 / 524 , and not in the Novel Feed Directive .
this is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives .
the text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998 .
but the vertical legislation in Directive 90 / 220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing .
it is before Parliament for second reading .
it is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90 / 220 and in particular , Article 11 .
reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies .
Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this .
there are just a few points I should like to make on that issue .
first of all , this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993 , so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers .
indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product .
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives .
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base , whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152 .
I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health .
this is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice , which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation .
the jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this .
as an overall comment to the suggested amendments here , particularly in relation to the legal base issue , it would be inappropriate , in my opinion , to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances , as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court .
a number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling .
directive 70 / 524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives .
it is already included now : &quot; indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products &quot; .
so this issue will be addressed .
that formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product , the subject matter of the application .
Mr President , allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question .
first allow me to point out , Commissioner Byrne , that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative .
but we do reserve the right , when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation , to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out .
nonetheless , we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content .
for example , you did not go into antibiotics .
we are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives .
my question , Commissioner Byrne is this : the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade .
do you really believe that , if we could , Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union ?
Commissioner Byrne , it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament .
we negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years .
I look forward to the next round .
. I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive ; it applies only to additives .
I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue .
it is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way , particularly in Directive 90 / 220 .
this issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it , which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision .
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue .
it is my intention , as it has always been , to work in cooperation with Parliament , to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results .
the best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before Parliament at the moment , as well as the legislation in the pipeline , rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in Directive 90 / 220 may not be fully taken into account .
it is best to wait for that debate which , I understand , will take place fairly soon .
all of these matters will be addressed in that legislation .
thank you , Commissioner .
Parliament has taken due note of your comments .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
scrapie
the next item is the report ( A5-0023 / 2000 ) by Mr Böge , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91 / 68 / EC as regards scrapie ( COM ( 1998 ) 623 - C4-0026 / 1999 - 1998 / 0324 ( COD ) ) .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it was and always will be one of life &apos; s mysteries , one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis , that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep .
I should , however , like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them BSE-infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie .
no new knowledge was needed , because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold .
from this point of view we are slightly behind the times .
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission &apos; s proposal on scrapie .
I should , however , like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions .
we therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the TSE proposal , and that of course includes scrapie .
when we discuss the TSE regulation , Commissioner , we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under Article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation , such as cosmetics , medicinal products or animal feed .
we insist on this .
as far as I am concerned , that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the Annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here .
it also means that , when we are fighting these diseases , the problem of destroying whole herds in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or BSE and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda .
although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the TSE regulation , I feel that the Commission &apos; s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendments on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposals when the Roth-Behrendt report is debated .
I should also like to address two other points . we expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs .
here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament .
finally , in discussing the question of the future application of tests , we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable .
but the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy , albeit not for every individual animal .
I would be grateful , Commissioner , if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against TSEs and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points .
Mr President , over the years , the following situation has arisen : one subject has developed into a subject of many facets .
many of us here in this House have spent years , whether we intended to or not , dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail .
and it is still on the agenda today .
it is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report .
the cast is always the same .
although the cause was unfortunate , it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament .
my task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one .
I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal .
that saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation , as Mr Böge has just done .
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House .
at first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now .
but I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing .
this debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity , Mr Byrne , to give the Commission a few things to think about .
although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf &apos; s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree , things may be different with this report .
allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which Mr Böge dealt with - and this form of collaboration between two committees , with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa , worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future - is relatively simple .
it will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal , Mr Byrne .
when we have the chance to ask direct questions , the questions which Mr Böge referred to will be asked .
questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries .
how will BSE status in fact be defined then ?
do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test ?
and then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne , a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you . what about the BSE test ?
when will you make it compulsory ?
perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report .
not that I want to put it off , but it would be a gesture , as it were , if you could say : here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test .
I know that I am a thorn in your side on this , but sometimes that is my job .
Cosmetic , medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous .
that is , without doubt , too short , too sweet and too little .
you are lucky that Mr Böge &apos; s report only deals with this on the sidelines ; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so .
finally , just one more brief comment , Mr Byrne .
we have a new Commission .
whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission , only time will tell .
but there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and I am sure that , as a lawyer and politician you will understand this . important issues cannot be regulated in annexes .
they belong in the legislative text . I might do the same if I were a Commissioner , because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament , which takes so long and is so difficult .
but you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this .
in other words , whenever I get the chance , I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text .
and you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe , healthy food which is produced , as a matter of principle , without any questionable or risky interim or end products .
over recent years , these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed .
the European Parliament has already taken a clear stand on BSE and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals .
we should not allow food safety to be compromised because , in the final analysis , it is our health which is at stake .
the Commission &apos; s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a Community regulation to fight scrapie .
this is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated .
animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent .
the spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers .
and I should point out that , for the first time in history , a case of scrapie was detected in Austria about four weeks ago .
scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food .
the disease is always fatal .
as there is no vaccination , farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie .
even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings , the connection with BSE has still not been clarified , as I have already said .
as a farmer myself , I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk .
I am in favour of preventive measures , starting with feeding which is suitable for the species , rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out .
I therefore welcome the Commission &apos; s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Böge &apos; s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament &apos; s temporary BSE Committee .
Mr Böge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee , and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him : he is the one with the experience .
I would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the Commission &apos; s proposal .
I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt &apos; s report from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session .
in the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease .
it is indeed .
for me as a Finn , and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals , it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals .
I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease .
the possibility , if necessary , of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement , as there really is justification for it .
the inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU .
on behalf of the European Liberal Democrats , we can support the Commission &apos; s proposal on Mr Böge &apos; s report , but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt &apos; s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur .
Mr President , I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur .
there is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field .
it is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important .
regardless of the many other concerns we may have , BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved .
it is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem .
I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will , I hope , address this situation .
we must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future .
no-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again .
we have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work .
it is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it .
BSE has certainly not gone away .
you can see it in different countries .
I do not want to point the finger at any particular country , but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom .
it will be there for some time to come .
we have to ensure that the whole system of traceability , of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain , is part of that confidence-building mechanism .
if we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future .
finally , I have certainly believed for a long time , coming from an agricultural background myself , that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place .
it was never the responsibility of the farmer , it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again .
. Mr President , I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission , namely combating TSEs .
I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue .
considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs .
this proposal addresses all TSE risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain .
I am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases .
I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation .
the detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal .
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative , as appears from your contributions this afternoon , to formulate a single text .
I am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation , especially after the reference made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue .
I look forward to receipt of that document , which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue .
finally , I would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between Parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions , speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation .
in the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system , I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve , that is , the translation of policy into legislation .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
Community policy in the field of water
the next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A5-0027 / 2000 ) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy ( 9085 / 3 / 1999 - C5-0209 / 1999 - 1997 / 0067 ( COD ) ) ( Rapporteur : Mrs Lienemann ) .
- ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century .
climate change , global resources , river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future .
we will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet &apos; s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions , the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even , more fundamentally , the global balance .
to support this statement , I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague , Mário Soares , in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans .
when talking about climate change , we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere .
yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet .
Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent , both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters , including its groundwater , surface waters and seas .
furthermore , Europe has signed international conventions , in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments .
in this it said that in a few years &apos; time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances .
despite having signed these international agreements , this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened .
this is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy , the European Parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives , particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR . this convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action .
the European Union &apos; s water policy is not starting from zero .
many directives have already been adopted . furthermore , the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives .
the preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation .
however , at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made , like OSPAR , but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs .
for despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection , when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved .
in many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts .
I am stressing this point because , when disasters are being reported daily in the news , we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done . then , in our haste , we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time .
the current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development , clear requirements , controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers , this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time .
it is also clear that if we do nothing , our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner .
even now , the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism .
to conclude , the issues are clear at this second reading .
do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR , in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero ?
do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive ?
do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water ?
do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples ?
the majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives . I hope they will be supported by this House .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us , especially as the very source of life for human beings .
the problem is one of both water quality and water resources , of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe , especially in very dry regions .
we have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994 .
a great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament , the European Commission and the Council of Ministers .
we reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77 , but another 30 have been added .
you see , there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different .
some want tighter legislation , some want more clarification , others want to serve national interests .
even within my group , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , there were , of course , differences of opinion .
our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions .
in this sense , the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position .
some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament &apos; s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers .
we obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament &apos; s credibility .
for me , that includes the zero demand , i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020 .
that would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings .
I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws , however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States .
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine , which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe , which was particularly polluted .
that does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money .
farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days .
you can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water .
the line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too .
I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter .
I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises .
I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann , for all her work and her cooperative attitude , even if we have agreed to differ on certain points .
and I also thank the representatives of the European Commission , who stood by with advice and expert help at all times .
if the representatives of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach , then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water .
the framework directive on water is a necessary initiative .
nevertheless , given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction , this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion .
nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us .
however , in Spain and the other southern countries , which have an unusual climate , the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures .
therefore , we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and , to this end , I ask that you support Amendment No 95 , which has been presented by our group .
we wish to ensure that Article 1 of the directive promotes the sustainable , efficient , fair and considerate use of water .
I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here .
one example is water transfers .
we would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to Community supervision .
we consider that , given the hydrological characteristics of Spain , where transfers of a structural nature are carried out , the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources , and these decisions should , of course , always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water .
with regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate , the application of tariffs , the Spanish Socialists have been arguing , in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay , that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption .
in Spain , a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe .
the Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses , owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive .
we have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs . this system should take good account of social , environmental and economic effects , and its implementation should be modulated in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions .
we want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment .
however , an environmental Europe cannot , in any circumstances , be built at different speeds , but must be built from a point of view of solidarity .
Mr President , the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all .
discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe .
this brings home the connections which bind us together .
this framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details .
it is important for us to remember that this is a framework .
these brushstrokes are indeed very broad .
it is easy for individual countries , for individual sectors of industry , to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days .
there are many opportunities to hide .
the reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come .
that is the time to debate some of these problems of detail .
the broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater , the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals , which we all need in society in all circumstances , should not be finding their way into our water system .
there is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation .
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing .
this is something that they prefer to avoid doing .
the principle also concerns water charging .
the basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation , to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water .
I want to refer to the political position here .
the common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading .
some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless .
it is a retrograde step .
this is an opportunity for us to improve the situation .
we need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation .
we have seen vote after vote lost .
measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee .
we have failed to achieve a qualified majority .
our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed .
we need to get into that conciliation position .
we need , at the end of the day , to ensure that we end up with a sensible , balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as long as nearly thirty years ago , the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy .
a hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated .
eventually , standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances .
the unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle .
some seven years ago , it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity .
the conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English .
this sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency .
that position is like holey cheese , or to keep it the sphere of water , as leaky as a sieve .
it explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment : nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading .
this is unusual , but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes .
the dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak .
the chemical industry and , unfortunately , the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance .
this is very time-consuming , and , more importantly , there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances .
only the background level of the ocean is acceptable .
this is what is meant by the term &quot; close-to-zero &quot; .
the Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances , many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect .
these are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause , even in extremely minimal quantities , changes in the gender of animals and even humans , as is more and more being ascertained by scientists .
this is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020 .
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission &apos; s list : mercury and tributyl , abbreviated to TBT .
on the bottom of the Wadden Sea , the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value , to wit , ten and one thousand times , respectively .
the chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes , and if this is impossible , to apply them in closed systems .
for the substance TBT , this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance .
a sound alternative would be to clean the ship &apos; s sides mechanically .
I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020 .
Mr President , the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive .
the Council &apos;s common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas .
therefore , our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete .
as members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals .
firstly , we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council .
we therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive .
secondly , I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently .
there should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented .
the legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions , such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected .
thirdly , we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy .
this means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used .
nowadays , taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming .
the obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay , although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases .
fourthly , we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined .
Fifthly , the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear .
against that background , our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann , the rapporteur , as adopted in committee .
we should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended .
we will therefore vote for the Greens &apos; Amendments Nos 102 , 103 and 104 , which we consider to be improvements on the present position .
as regards pricing policy , there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report .
my own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43 , tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens &apos; Amendment No 105 .
I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned .
however , some people in our political group think otherwise .
consequently , Amendment No 107 , on the same question , has been tabled by one section of our group only .
on the whole , I welcome the committee &apos;s proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann &apos;s report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise .
Mr President , every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet , yet the abundance of water is an illusion .
the recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders .
water is a renewable but limited natural resource .
it becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable .
in the EU , this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas .
the increase in vulnerable areas , both wet and dry , inequalities between countries , inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic , economic , geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need . however , these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community .
we have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water , given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land .
agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive .
it is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought . last October in Turin , the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean .
we are not , fortunately , at this point .
however , we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods , which the directive underlines .
for example , France , the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding .
we need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other .
yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water .
the water issue will definitely not be settled today .
in fact , the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects .
Mr President , it is very likely that , during this century , good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil .
this is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water .
it seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework .
with the framework directive on water policy , we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU &apos; s water legislation .
but that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies .
more specifically , the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by Member States and water boards , which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach , need to be maximised .
the key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water , the protection of eco systems , the promotion of the sustainable use of water , the control of floods and droughts and the termination of discharging dangerous substances into surface water .
as far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned , I am of the opinion that the Councils &apos; objectives lack both commitment and ambition .
the Committee on the Environment &apos; s present proposal to reduce discharges to close-to-zero is , in my view , to be welcomed and worthy of emulation .
however , a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability .
consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced , as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control , and which pollute the water quite substantially .
Mr President , we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect .
in the 20th century , water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances , special waste , chemicals and so on . and we can already see the consequences !
we need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation .
the directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here .
in the final analysis , water protection is not just a social question , it is a decisive social question , which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences .
given the advanced state of pollution of water resources , it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements .
Mr President , it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz , assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher , put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety .
it is not an easy topic and , in my opinion , the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed .
the decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage .
the topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result , we have been able to draft important , more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading .
in fact , the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal .
it is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge .
I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect : in the North of Europe , we often face floods , but also polluted water , from industry , whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances , simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture .
I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail .
I would first of all like to focus on quality .
the Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy .
a very important component , to wit , one third of our drinking water , is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands .
the Netherlands is located downstream , in a delta , which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance .
another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality .
in a number of amendments , the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question .
although I understand that , according to some , this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially , I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure .
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management .
in his poem &quot; Herinneringen aan Holland &quot; &#91; &quot; Reminiscing about Holland &quot; &#93; , a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too , which , with its never-ending trail of destruction , was feared and respected .
in 1953 , we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology .
when our rivers flooded in 1990 , we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage .
this means that in terms of quantity management too , we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it .
Mr President , I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work .
water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right .
everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident , as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too .
water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples .
this is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination .
we need to recognise that water is a joint liability .
cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident .
too little operational capacity upstream or , in fact , excessive use , can cause problems downstream .
coordination is the key word here .
the problem of water is becoming increasingly topical .
changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation .
some areas are becoming drier , whilst many are becoming wetter .
it is time for action .
in March , the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague .
this Forum stands for a worldwide vision .
this vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control .
the time for action is upon us .
the European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time .
but we should not lower our standards too much either .
the common position is not ambitious enough .
this is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements , or the OSPAR objectives .
we need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020 .
this has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too .
the OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up .
a list has been compiled , containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment .
it is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again .
Needless to say , the directive also needs to be binding .
countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives .
quality has a price , but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future .
Mr President , Commissioner , my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive .
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change , the depletion of primeval forests and overfishing , constantly affect our common and vital but , in some ways , unowned resources .
we should also recognise that , in Europe , our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one .
it is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established .
it is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are , irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common watercourse .
ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive does indeed , as many speakers have already said , represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal EU regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe .
however , I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation .
I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points .
first OSPAR .
we know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough ; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment .
merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough .
what we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR .
only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and , more importantly , objectives which are enforceable under the law .
anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters , such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary , from happening to us .
I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection , despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR .
but I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament , in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised .
it is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth .
we must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists ; on the contrary , we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and , hence , cost-covering prices .
water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention .
with closed production circuits this is possible ; anything else would water down the directive .
let us grab our chance .
I know that this directive may have problems , given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union , as has already been mentioned .
the situation in the north is different from that in the south , and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas .
I understand this .
however , there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south , specifically Amendment No 43 which , with regard to the recuperation of costs , also indicates that Member States must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making .
there are also difficulties with the issue of transfers .
in my country - I live in the north of Spain - , there is a considerable difference between the north and the south , and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another .
however , Mrs Lienemann &apos; s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water .
I know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties , but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the Danube and what happened in Doñana .
we cannot allow our European water to be polluted , Mr President , and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water , which is so precious to all of us .
Mr President , my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report .
as an Irish Member of the European Parliament , coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water , I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive .
however , I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament &apos;s Committee on the Environment and the Council .
the latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter .
according to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force , whereas Parliament &apos;s Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years .
I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible .
I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage .
the Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage .
no specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position .
Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently .
moreover , an adequate contribution from different economic sectors , broken down into industrial , household and agricultural sectors , must ensure that this policy is implemented .
unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states .
this is politically impractical from an Irish perspective , as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal , Greece and Spain .
Mr President , I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report .
it is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come .
we can do this by , as a Parliament , amending the Council &apos; s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment .
in its unaltered form , the present directive could , in fact , have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water .
it would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people .
it is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters .
the directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation .
we cannot afford to wait .
in this connection , I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108 , in which the words &quot; water pollution caused by individual pollutants &quot; are replaced by &quot; prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges &quot; .
we cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment .
the EU &apos; s Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention , which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment .
this Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and , not least , to our descendants .
Mr President , it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive .
the Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention , for the implementation of the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment .
clearly , the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non-polluting systems , seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage , particularly our water resources .
this situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy , and especially in the agricultural sector .
the obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derives from this notion , with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions .
we must not , with this in mind , pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting , improving and restoring their quality , as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques .
as regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment , an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels , which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities .
finally , we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances , using the increased information available on their chemical , physical and biological properties , in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage , which is fundamental to us all .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously , then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption .
we can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards .
in this respect , I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that , when people use water , they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks .
this directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting .
first there is wide information for and involvement by the public , a rarity in a European directive .
secondly , there is compulsory cooperation .
I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality .
thirdly , I should like to address the question of the timetable .
I am firmly convinced that we need a strict , tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective .
compare it with what happens in December .
we all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents .
but what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years &apos; time .
we all know what we would do , which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy .
I emphatically support the rapporteur &apos; s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive , from the list of measures to the question of employment measures .
Mr President , the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the Member States work together to protect groundwater , drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing EU environmental legislation .
may I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States , in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution .
the present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives .
it is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances .
this cannot be done , and it also , in any case , goes against nature .
adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of , for example , phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment .
European agriculture would not , for example , be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread .
as a result , agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU , with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs .
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , water is a precious raw material .
millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal .
it should , therefore , not surprise us that water is the cause of wars .
the capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs .
general interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation .
Europe is therefore facing an arduous task ; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation .
I have to admit that in Flanders , where I come from , we still have a long way to go too .
we were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter .
anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way .
the common position is in this respect a farce , a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements .
the period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years .
by then , my children will be older than I am now .
you have to admit : this is a joke .
tomorrow , we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children .
either we opt for the amendments of my group , of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment .
I would like to finish off with this observation .
in the past couple of months , we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium .
what was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers .
in our own country , this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations .
they have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament &apos; s more drastic positioning .
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware .
ladies and gentlemen , fine words are no longer sufficient .
we need to change tack completely .
during the vote tomorrow , we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy .
this can only benefit our credibility .
the debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m .
the dialogue on Europe - institutional reform
the next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform : the issues at stake .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today . I am basically here to speak to you , as indicated by your agenda , on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform .
this morning , in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi , many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions .
yet it is not just a question of who does what , as one of you said very clearly and forcefully .
ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do .
we must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future , particularly with the countries which will be joining us .
we also plan to establish direct contacts in universities , schools and factories , to meet the people , answer their questions and listen to them . in this way we will play our part , as will you , in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do .
we hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament .
we will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work .
we also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments , local elected representatives , non-governmental organisations , socio-professional organisations and the media .
opinion multipliers , political groups and parties , MEPs and national MPs , elected representatives , as I have just said , local authorities or national parliaments , the Committee of the Regions , the Economic and Social Committee , organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved .
need I remind you that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on 1 February ? I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are , of course , the representatives of the people in each Member State .
the Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership .
we are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament .
I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits .
we want to encourage debate among the people .
I therefore took a European Commissioner , and not just the French ones , or ambassadors posted in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week . this made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected , listened to and informed .
financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001 . it will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process .
we will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of 700 young Commission stagiaires .
your President , Mrs Fontaine , has agreed to take part with Mr Prodi and several Commissioners in this initial dialogue . I can assure you that , whenever a Commissioner intends to engage in dialogue , the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament .
that is all I have to say for the moment .
I welcome any questions , suggestions or proposals from the Members present .
colleagues , you know the rules .
you are expected to ask questions , not necessarily make lengthy statements .
you have one minute each in which to ask your question .
Mr President , I think I also speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that I chair , in expressing my appreciation of this Commission initiative .
moreover , this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November .
I have also heard Commissioner Barnier &apos; s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme .
if I may make a suggestion , Commissioner Barnier , would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject , in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament ?
we therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings , and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the Commission &apos; s initiative .
I understand your concern , Mr Napolitano , and an interinstitutional working group will be set up . its first meeting should take place in March .
I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission &apos; s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other . I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint .
you realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is music to my ears to hear you use the word &apos; citizen &apos; so often .
we are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion . the fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it .
in terms of the IGC issue , I have a specific question for you . I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF .
as you know , there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens .
given the urgency surrounding this issue , has the Commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti-fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud , in the Member States and in the European institutions , coming under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice ?
Mr Dupuis , first of all I attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word &apos; citizen &apos; .
it is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used .
we will conduct this dialogue with our citizens , including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision-making or information centres .
in reply to your second point on the Court of Justice , we have not yet established our position on the Court of Justice because we were waiting for the Dur report which was published a few days ago .
the Commission , as I have promised , will complete its proposals on the IGC opinion about the legal system and the Court of Justice within the next few weeks .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , the day before yesterday , there was a leading news item in the most popular Danish news programme , which I would ask you to comment on .
the story went that an official in the Commission had apparently told an Austrian businessman that , because he was Austrian , he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries , including Denmark .
I would ask you to confirm that , if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects , then this official has got the wrong end of the stick , and that , if he has not said this , then there is no story .
will you confirm what is the case ?
Mr Haarder , to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing .
my personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people , businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition .
therefore , subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting , I can confirm what you have just said , that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort .
generally speaking , there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria . I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957 .
this is why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the EU Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis . finally , this is why we have public debate .
the only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives , which brings me back to the subject of our discussion . I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate , particularly to fight against demagoguery .
Commissioner Barnier , you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe .
with reference to the IGC , as you know , under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC .
clearly , Parliament has its own representatives present , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos .
but would you , Commissioner , also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you , with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress ?
Mr Beazley , my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise .
Mr Napolitano , the chairman , and many other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that , on behalf of the Commission , I will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations , in a spirit of transparency .
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that , in many cases , we will say this together .
it is very important that these negotiations is not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliaments which , when all said and done , will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process .
this is why I congratulate Mr Napolitano &apos; s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the Fifteen and the European Parliament .
having said that , the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions .
I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year .
Mr President , firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach .
I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage . this did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust .
I have two questions . firstly , you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission .
do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well , that is to say via the television and Internet ?
my second question is of a critical nature .
the European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency .
if I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands , then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model , and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands .
my question is really : how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC , because the present directive is not a good example of this .
Mrs Maij-Weggen , given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC , it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now .
the group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible .
the documents will in the main be open working documents .
although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media , I am committed , as I must be at this stage , to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission &apos; s viewpoint .
I can confirm , and thank you for having asked me about this , that we will use all the most modern means , television in particular , to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe .
we will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums .
the Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised .
these are the modern means to be used .
however , I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people .
although this may be a rather Utopian ideal , I want a Commissioner , when he can , an MEP , a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe .
I have evidence that this is possible .
the majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions .
although this may seem rather egotistical , I want the Commission , in the minds of the people , to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible .
Mr President , I welcome Mr Barnier &apos; s commitment to go to the regions , both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say .
I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire , a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding .
he can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner .
I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign ?
in some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be .
that is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist .
the Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign .
Mr Corbett , thank you for your comments .
I willingly accept your invitation . if I have understood you correctly , you want me , when I come to Yorkshire , to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds .
I can perform this dual task .
I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments , as I have already done , not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ .
ten days ago I was in Westminster , so you can see , Mr Corbett , that I am not afraid of the difficulties .
next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin .
I have already appeared before the French Senate .
therefore , throughout this debate , whenever I can , I will go directly to see the national parliaments too .
with regard to the dialogue with our citizens , it is not a question of propaganda or marketing , nor even of communication .
I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue . so , after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform , those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion .
I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States . I sincerely hope , with your support , that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate .
Mr President , I should like to join Mr Barnier &apos; s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with .
it is not much fun , of course , having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself .
is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States &apos; election processes ?
it is , of course , these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments .
can such matters be controlled from Brussels ?
is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning ?
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference , not merely to relations between the Union and Member States , but also the Union , the Member States , regions and cities .
I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe , Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears .
Commissioner , I want to go back to one of your previous answers . in this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and , in particular , the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State , pursuant to Article 7 , for the violation of fundamental freedoms .
do you believe that these proposals , or proposals of this type , form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki ?
I do not think so .
are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion , unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking ?
yes , Mr Bonde , we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission .
I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated .
in terms of social protection , I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology .
in your country , Mr Bonde , like everywhere else , I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people .
this will therefore be our rule .
we are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market . our proposal is not general or systematic .
I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues .
I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical .
this has never been the case . we are simply trying to ensure , in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States , the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27 .
we will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions .
Mr Berthu , the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this .
it specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam .
it also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies .
the Commission is acting correctly if , on a particular point , it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions . I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7 .
however , if we do , this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response . we will also do this with regard for the future in general .
we will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957 , and even before that , on the rubble of the Second World War .
everything which can be done will be useful . I am sure that you and I , Mr Berthu , can at least agree on this .
thank you , Commissioner .
you have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to .
you have set a very good example of time-keeping today .
that concludes the debate .
question Time ( Commission )
the next item is Question Time ( B5-0009 / 2000 ) . we will examine questions to the Commission .
first part
question No 36 by ( H-0025 / 00 ) :
subject : high infant mortality in Kosovo According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation , Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe ; almost 50 % of babies born prematurely die , while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm .
in the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the Union and the efforts of its envoy Bernard Kouchner , will the Commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of Kosovo &apos;s right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women , women in childbirth and babies ?
Mr President , the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo , not just for pregnant women but across the board .
this results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it .
the statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable .
however , the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population .
the Commission &apos; s response has been as follows : firstly , the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding .
ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care , on support to institutions as well as vaccination .
however , efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province .
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field .
secondly , under the reconstruction programme , urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme .
progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city .
however , the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project .
we hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation .
under the European Community &apos; s damage assessment , estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million .
the Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds .
we expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system .
the emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement .
work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise .
Commissioner , this morning President Prodi , among others , stressed that the Balkans are testing our ability to act effectively , the very credibility of the European Union is on trial , and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed .
Commissioner , do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo , are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises ?
besides , Commissioner , is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo ?
do you think that so much inaction is excusable when , on the continent of Europe itself , the right to life is at risk ?
I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it , which have been working incredibly hard in Kosovo , would regard it as an adequate description of their labours to suggest that they had been standing idly by .
I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that .
of course , she is entirely correct in saying that the Union &apos; s credibility is on the line with what happens , not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole .
I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance .
I would just make two points about the situation in Kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along WHO lines .
first of all , I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo , and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all .
as a result of that , a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society .
so what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment .
secondly , and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well , some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby , but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born .
those were cases in which women who during the hostilities , or before the hostilities , tragically killed their own children .
we are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo .
we have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour , but it is not going to be easy .
Commissioner , I would like to thank you for your response to the Member &apos; s first question and the supplementary question .
however , I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO , among others , are often of inferior quality .
in some cases , there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like .
are you aware of this ?
are you prepared to act upon it ?
this is my first additional question .
my second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica .
you are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that , given the tense situation , Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all .
what does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital ?
on the first question , I am going myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable Member about the ECHO food package .
I have not heard that suggestion before , but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there .
secondly , I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica .
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago , I saw the situation there for myself .
I had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities , including the leader of the Albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently .
so I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo , whatever ethnic group they come from .
the particular difficulties in Mitrovica - for example , it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital , Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems .
we will try to address them , but it is not easy .
question No 37 by ( H-0029 / 00 ) :
subject : Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social , economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999 , what steps is the Commission taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia ?
the Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries .
in the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey , as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict .
Mr President , the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union .
will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because , in the final analysis , we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union ?
my question therefore is this : will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions ?
the key issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can .
we have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia .
let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union .
the situation of Turkey &apos;s relations with its neighbours will , as the honourable Member asks , be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy .
as stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote : &quot; enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts &quot; .
that statement could not be much clearer .
but I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results .
question No 38 by ( H-0040 / 00 ) :
subject : implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status , what is the Commission &apos;s view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam , given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result ?
the Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region .
we will , however , consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities , together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey .
I have a related point .
it concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole .
as you know , the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular .
given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict , of so-called &quot; water wars &quot; , in the coming decades , what is the Commission &apos;s view about the potential destabilisation , both in Turkey and in the wider region , that will be caused by this dam ?
can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well ?
we will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member .
we have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up .
there have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area .
we will raise that , too , in the representations we make .
a number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern , such as the effect on displaced farmers .
on the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form .
question No 39 by ( H-0036 / 00 ) :
subject : drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up . it is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century .
what are the Commission &apos;s views on the substance of the Charter ? what type of rights will the Charter set out ( economic , social and cultural ) ?
which citizens will it cover ( those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement ? will it cover immigrants etc . ? )
will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda ?
what means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes ?
what are the Commission &apos;s views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union ?
like the honourable Member , the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights . in the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter &apos; s content .
according to these conclusions , the Charter must contain three categories of rights . the first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights , as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
the Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council .
having said that , this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources .
as I have said before in this House , the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able , if necessary , to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances , particularly technological and social changes .
however , given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State and Government , this power must be exercised with caution and on a case-by-case basis .
the rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary .
some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union .
it may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the European Union and third-country nationals meeting certain conditions .
it is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail .
as I have also said before to this House , the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty .
however , we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government .
the difficult part , which will fall to the Convention , is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the Treaties .
in its opinion on the holding of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties , the Commission noted that the European Council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the IGC agenda , in particular the European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Commissioner , it is quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in Europe , men and women , are being called upon to redefine their rights and obligations .
we hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality .
globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other , make it urgently necessary to define those rights .
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting .
but if we are to secure the public &apos; s participation in this new planning , we would like to learn what plan the European bodies and specifically the Commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century .
I listened to your general guidelines and I would like to ask you what is the position of children , as entities in their own right , in the Commission &apos; s plans for the new model of society in the twenty-first century .
Mr President , Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , in my opinion , and as Mr Prodi said this morning , the drawing up of the Charter is an exercise with great political significance . this is because it shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project .
in this context , the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated .
the essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions , as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union .
I understand your concern about the rights of children .
many elements of our work , and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs , involve protecting the rights of children .
this is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully .
each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children .
as for the EU &apos; s responsibility , the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship , in its broadest sense , of children .
I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention .
Mr President , I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach .
however , I should like to ask a slightly different question .
we have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year .
would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter ?
it is very important that the people feel engaged in this process .
I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has .
will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate ?
it is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights , not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is .
I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights .
we can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text , a text that can be easily read by the citizens , and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument .
there is no contradiction between the two .
the challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter .
I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here .
question No 40 by ( H-0095 / 00 ) :
subject : articles 6.1 , 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
it is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government . this was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi &apos; s speech on that government which includes Ministers from Jörg Haider &apos; s Freedom Party .
I am referring , of course , to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000 , the basic elements of which I would like to restate .
the Commission confirmed then , as it does today , that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency &apos; s statement of 1 February 2000 .
these concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them .
there is no need for me to remind you of Jörg Haider &apos; s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements , which are also anti-European .
the fact that an openly extremist , racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other States that are taking part in the European project . the European Commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either .
secondly , the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties , specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union .
one of the most important innovations provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the Member States . another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled , and which would react if any of them were violated .
the Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars : that of the rule of law .
this principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made .
the Commission is not a State . it cannot and must not act as if it were one .
in order to give a precise answer to your question , Mr Ford , I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied , there must be proof of the existence and I quote , of a &quot; serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6 . &quot;
I repeat , a &quot; serious and persistent breach &quot; is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State .
I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria .
as a matter of fact I think that I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled , either in Austria or in any other Member State .
I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission , as stated once again by President Prodi this morning , to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7 .
I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary .
the values at stake are too central , too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises .
individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say .
in Austria &apos; s case , the statements are contradictory to say the least .
on the one hand , any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party .
on the other hand , the new Austrian Government &apos; s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights .
we will soon have our first opportunity , and an excellent opportunity it will be , to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one .
I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission &apos; s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives .
one applies to the principle of treating people equally , without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin . the other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin , religion , handicap or sexual persuasion .
these are significant texts , adopted in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty , which gave the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race , ethnic origin , sex etc .
lastly , I would like to assure you , Mr Ford , that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities , should it prove necessary .
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question .
but is Commissioner Vitorino aware , not only of Mr Haider &apos;s and the Freedom Party &apos;s words , but also of their deeds ?
Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens , where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities .
could the Commissioner answer two questions .
firstly he talked about verification .
can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it ?
secondly , does he not agree that were the current government , at a national level , to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level , then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6 ( 1 ) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action ?
we are not talking about words here .
we are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider .
it is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty .
therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria , as in any other Member State .
if any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs , we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly .
I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament , but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations , which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission .
regarding the situation in Carinthia , we need to look at this in detail .
the honourable Member raised the question .
the protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council .
we should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question .
that question calls for reflection , for debate and , if necessary , for action .
I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the Commission has presented to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination , racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur .
thank you very much , Mr Vitorino , for your valuable contribution to this Question Time .
second part
questions to Mrs Wallström
question No 41 by ( H-0021 / 00 ) :
subject : surplus electrical and electronic equipment Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment ( 6 million tonnes &apos; worth in 1998 ) , mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent .
the environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances ( lead , cadmium , mercury , hexavalent chrome , PVC and halogenated flame retarders ) .
a preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions , the most recent of which dates from July 1999 .
can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft , which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998 ?
is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation ( for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade ) if it is adopted ?
the Commission agrees with MEPs that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems .
consequently , the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and , since 1997 , has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned .
the outcome of the discussions , as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area , are now being examined by the Commission .
some parts of the proposal have been criticised , among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants , as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .
the United States &apos; delegation to the European Union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper , inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned , as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers &apos; responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .
the main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are , they say , incompatible with international trade law .
the Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States &apos; arguments .
I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter .
my question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft .
there have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one , to my knowledge , dating from July 1999 .
is this the text which you will be submitting , or an amendment to the original version ?
version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government .
I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible , you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation .
the arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules .
this worries me because this means that , when adopting texts , we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation . this will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal .
thank you for the follow-up question .
it is important for me to have a chance to answer it .
it is clear that in a process such as this , where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe , there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned .
the dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal .
parts of it have been strengthened , but other parts may well contain too many compromises .
we are still in the process of preparing a text , and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment .
I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations .
I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards .
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these .
however , I do want to listen to all the points of view .
for example , I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal .
however , I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive .
in fact , I believe that we should be showing the way , an intention that will also characterise the final proposal .
question No 42 by ( H-0026 / 00 ) :
subject : gender and environment Practically all the contributors involved in the Rio and Kyoto processes - individual organisations , civic action groups , governments , the World Bank , the UN and relief organisations - believed that women should take a greater part in decision-making on the environment .
more women in decision-making positions on various environmental bodies would extend the predominantly male terms of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well .
is the Commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision-making in the environmental field ?
in 1988 , the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men .
through the current programme , which covers the period 1997 to 2000 , we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender-specific needs are taken into consideration .
one of the programme &apos;s aims is to develop and supervise methods , strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility .
within the framework of the action plan , each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures .
one of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions .
the new Commission &apos;s own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office .
the same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment , where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women .
our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions .
currently , women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts , and we hope the number will increase steadily .
moreover , we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups .
as regards our external partners , all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to democratise their decision-making processes .
with respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality , as you know , this principle is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Article 3 of the Treaty states that , in all the activities referred to in this Article , the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities , and to promote equality , between women and men .
the Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field .
I should , of course , like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament &apos; s Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities , particularly its chair .
I should just like to recall that , during the lengthy process of approving the present Commission , every Commissioner was questioned by the Women &apos; s Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field .
we shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully , so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned .
thank you for your reply .
I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields .
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes .
environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work .
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes .
this is a crucial goal .
in order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality , it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required .
.
( SV ) My understanding of mainstreaming is , of course , that this should characterise everything we do .
in the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General , issues of equality play a very important role .
for example , I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission .
if we are to be able to motivate everybody , I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or , if you prefer , from the bottom up .
my impression of environment-related work , broadly speaking , is that in many instances it is dominated by women .
this state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field .
I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention , but there is certainly room for improvement .
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up .
I hope that this will be of benefit .
question No 43 by ( H-0045 / 00 ) :
subject : the Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area ( SPA ) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive , as it is an area of international importance .
however , the Department of the Marine , Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission &apos;s insistence .
what is more , a very large warehouse has been constructed , in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation .
how can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area ?
is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely , pending a review of the development plans of the area ?
the Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour , but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member .
the harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan .
the Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive .
that means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community &apos; s Habitats Directive .
since 1998 , the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan , which are now designated a part of the special protection area , and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed .
after investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced , in the summer of 1999 , that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour .
an in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out .
the most serious harm caused by the project , the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats , was only to be temporary , and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats .
at the Commission &apos;s suggestion , the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area , from which they had previously been excluded .
furthermore , to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats , the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved .
however , since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute .
firstly , the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements .
they then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts .
however , the new commitment included some minor changes which , in turn , led to a further complaint .
in view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved , the Commission will not , for the present , propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended .
however , it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities , particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts .
- I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said .
the mudflat at Stregrennan , which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission , has been completely destroyed at this stage .
it is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives .
you say there will be no further funding .
I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation .
if not , why not ?
if you are , when exactly are you going to do it ?
is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence , and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100 % ?
is this right and proper ?
what is your opinion on that ?
any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives .
even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed .
compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done .
the first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place .
as a result , the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means .
the use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what I referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary .
there is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge .
the adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities , and does not require prior Commission approval .
the Commission &apos; s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met , and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging .
in this case , the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass .
we are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the Structural Funds .
Mr President , sadly , the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one .
there are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of EU funding .
will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States saying that , if in future it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out , it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted , in other words , reclaim the money from the Member States ?
it is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future .
.
( SV ) This is a very important question .
as MEPs are well aware , in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission , Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds , money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives .
the message contained in the joint text is still valid .
we cannot hand out money with one hand and , with the other , take countries to court , where they may well be fined . it is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy .
the result may , of course , be some difficult questions of priorities .
in my view , the most important consequence , however , is that countries should do some careful thinking and , above all , make sure they send in their lists of Natura 2000 sites .
then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedures .
in that respect , Ireland falls short , like other Member States , but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results .
I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good .
the Rules of Procedure do not allow this .
you will have to discuss this outside the Chamber .
questions to Mr Barnier
-
question No 44 by ( H-0020 / 00 ) :
however , local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that &apos; partnership &apos; arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance .
has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies ?
in what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what steps will the Commission take to ensure greater participation by the &apos; partners &apos; in all measures taken under the new CSF ?
I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies . I am also saying this as a former environment minister .
turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos , who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject , the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor , during the preparation of the new programming period , the application of the partnership principle .
the involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community &apos; s action is , as you know , one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation .
with regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece , the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period .
Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster . during these visits , I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement .
as for subsequent phases , in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes , it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level . it must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national , regional and local level .
as for the monitoring and management of these programmes , I have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the Greek Government pursuant to Article 8 of the new Regulation .
in the current negotiations on this third Community support framework , I have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected , with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non-governmental organisations and associations .
within the third CSF , this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee .
this is all I can say .
I thank the Commissioner , and do not at all question his intentions and interventions , which adopted a positive line .
however , things are really quite different .
the operation of the Community Support Framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state , government and party delirium as regards the European Union &apos; s funding .
I cannot show you the television programmes here but I can show you the Greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections .
there are only a few weeks to go before the elections .
this is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates , financed by the European Union , the CSF .
my question to the Commissioner is this : what is to be done ?
will the Commission remain silent ?
will it discuss the matter ?
will it bring it up with the Greek Government or will we persist with the pathological situation we had with the previous Commission ?
Mr Alavanos , I see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited .
would you let me have these documents so that I can read them , after I have had them translated ? I can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication , which I can only welcome as the Commissioner for Regional Policy , and what is propaganda .
then if it is really necessary for me to do this , I will make comments or recommendations to the Greek Government .
I would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or I will come and get them from you later on .
having said that , I thought your question related more to the partnership issue .
further to your questions on the pre-electoral period , I can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non-governmental organisations .
I can only quote what is contained in the general Structural Funds Regulation which specifies that the Commission will work with the governments of the Member States . it is therefore the Greek Government which is my primary partner .
subsequently , if I need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised , then I will do this .
I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government .
I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them , because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes .
however , turning to the substance , I should like to ask the Commissioner to bear in mind the following : that for all national and regional programmes , Greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the European Union - via its central administration , its central government .
from that point of view , neither local governments and much less non-governmental organisations , for example the farming cooperatives which would be interested in further development of the farming sector , have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third Community Support Framework , nor have they had any involvement in the previous CSFs .
what can the Commission do about that ?
however , I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations .
having said this , I will look at the situation objectively .
why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years , on the part of the Greek Government , some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society ?
I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted , this must be remedied .
I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework .

question No 45 by ( H-0041 / 00 ) :
subject : Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period , 1994-1999 , no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas ?
can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period ?
what role will aid from the Structural Funds play , on the other hand , in the promotion of renewable energy ?
can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional , renewable energy sources ?
will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks ?
on Mrs Isler Béguin &apos; s first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community &apos; s priorities during the previous programming period .
the support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion , or research and technical developments , within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion .
this is about 6 % of the whole Community contribution .
with regard to your specific concern , I can say that , as in the previous period , the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission .
however , it is still the responsibility of the Member States &apos; management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs .
consequently , even though this is not a Community priority , a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area , provided that these projects contribute to regional development . the Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these .
on your second point of renewable energy which , as you know , is of great interest to me , the Commission &apos; s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds .
these Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources , where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level .
I was able to verify this , for example , during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy .
the Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department .
finally , on large-scale energy transmission networks , the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation .
this is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions . it is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains , for example .
Commissioner , thank you for your answer . however , I asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled &apos; International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor &apos; .
this project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds , such as those listed in Objective 1 , might welcome this type of installation .
we would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific &apos; nuclear research &apos; context .
you did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks .
could you please give an answer on this issue ?
you are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere .
quite simply there is no question of this .
I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation .
as a result , the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected .
however , you are right to question me as this is your task , as mine is to answer you .
as has happened in the past , the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification .
I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point .
the Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible .
I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks .
the energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union . assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions , particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped .
this is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds .

question No 46 by ( H-0052 / 00 ) :
subject : Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission &apos;s recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality , I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality .
in particular , would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States , with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries ?
Mr MacCormick , the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated , for the 2000-2006 period , in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds .
as in the past , these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State .
in this respect , it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional .
the cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure .
provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure , the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected .
as for the budgetary provisions within the Member States , between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries , these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules .
please excuse this very legal answer .
however , after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle .
- I am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content .
we are left with Article 11 ( 1 ) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States .
very well : that is to be the unchanging rule .
does section 11 ( 1 ) conceivably authorise the following practice .
when an autonomous region &apos;s or country &apos;s funding from European structural funds increases , the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region , so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union .
is that really authorised ?
unfortunately I do not have time to go into depth on this issue . if Mr MacCormick would be satisfied with my partial agreement with his reasoning , I will give him a full answer in writing by restating the legal bases of both Article 11 in general and Article 11 ( 1 ) in particular .
I am aware of the Member &apos; s competence on these matters .
I also know the particular problems in your constituency in Scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects .
however , on a general level , I would say that in all cases it is the Structural Funds expenditure which must be additional . this is how , provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure , the Structural Funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected .
I will go further in the written answer which I have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely .
- Additionality is a major issue too in Wales , which I represent .
just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales .
as recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality , at that time linked to the RECHAR funding .
this led to an agreement being signed whereby the UK Government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that EU spending reached the areas for which is was intended and was actually additional .
and yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland .
could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the UK Government ?
I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales .
I will verify this point and , if you wish , I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick .
question No 47 by ( H-0088 / 00 ) :
subject : amount which Andalusia will receive from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period According to the Commission &apos; s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the Berlin Summit ( which include per capita GDP , the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants ) , what amount is to be allocated to Andalusia from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period ?
questions to Mr Bolkestein
as I did not fully understand the plan , I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs , Mr Rato , in a letter of 14 December which I have here , to ask him for more information on the document submitted .
in the coming weeks , the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the Community support framework for the new period of 2000-2006 . during these meetings I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation .
therefore , if you wish , as soon as I have this information by sector and region , I will personally send you the information on Andalusia .
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters .
I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints .
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government .
you may answer the question .
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , I hear that you have a strong voice . I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me .
I have given you my answer .
I am keen that the Structural Funds , particularly those in Objective 1 , are allocated where needed .
we have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive .
I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country . I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation .
it is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible .
I need to know about this allocation , however , and this is why I said that I could not answer today .
as I did not have an answer , I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December .
I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it .
I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and , in this case , passionate intervention .
I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections , and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections .
it should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time , since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again .
I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50 % more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds , which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks .
lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question : do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable ?
this is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related .
having said this , we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union .
I am pleased that the Structural Funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain .
we were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens , about public debates .
the more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life , even when we disagree , the better this will be , provided that we talk about this objectively .
I am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the Structural Funds Regulation .
this Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years .
we will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which I regard as an important time for making an assessment with and before this House and for outlining future prospects . the time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendments to be highlighted .
for the time being , please let me apply the Regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in Berlin .
this is all I can say today .
thank you very much for your replies , Mr Barnier .
questions Nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing .
question No 51 by ( H-0049 / 00 ) :
subject : new premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market ( OHIM ) is still operating from the same temporary premises , even though its new building was opened in June 1999 .
in view of this unusual situation , will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises ?
the honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time .
furthermore , I have asked the president of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market , that is to say the Office in Alicante , to comment further on this new question and I can , as a result , inform the honourable Member as follows , on behalf of the Office :
the Office is not yet ready to move into the new building .
unfortunately , a number of deadlines have been exceeded .
a number of technical provisions need to be made , such as the installation of a computer network , archives , a canteen and furniture .
the OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June .
during the previous question , we were discussing electoral issues .
I believe that this issue is relevant to my question . Commissioner , you were not present at the extraordinarily named &apos; official opening &apos; of the headquarters of the OHIM on 9 June , in the middle of an election campaign in Spain leading up to both the European elections and the local and regional elections .
if you had been there , I am sure you would have been ashamed .
the President of the Commission and some secretaries were present .
in the middle of an election campaign , a series of authorities , all of them run by the party in government , made clearly electioneering speeches which , furthermore , were broadcast live on television .
it was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government , as well as his own work , although it was irrelevant to that event .
the opening of a building which was not finished , in the middle of an election campaign , which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied , makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous .
I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish , because at the end of the day it was their responsibility , but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing , through its presence , this absurd event .
I would therefore like to ask you , Mr Commissioner : does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign ?
does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government ?
it does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one Member State or another .
as such , I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described .
I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain .
what I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible .
may I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference .
I hope that this building will then be occupied .
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question .
as members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons .
a year later , it is still not functioning , which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening .
we should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified .
I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions .
it is , however , interested in official statements and actions .
we do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un procès d &apos;intention .
we are concerned with public official actions and events , rather than any possible underlying motivation .
this is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question .
once again , the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned . it only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible .
also , the Commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual .
as far as I am concerned , all expenditure is real .
and any remaining skeletons , I intend to leave them in the cupboard .
question No 54 by ( H-0117 / 00 ) :
subject : alcohol monopoly and the internal market What action does the Commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the State alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by Sweden , and the associated import restrictions , and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied ?
I would like to answer these two questions as follows .
when Sweden joined the European Union , it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages which travellers can bring into the country from other Member States .
this derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 June of this year .
Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years , as this would be necessary to protect public health .
my position on this is clear .
Sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the Union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist .
I cannot see a reason , therefore , why a further extension for this measure should be proposed .
European citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use , including taxes , in any Member Sate and to take them to another Member Sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them .
that is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time .
we want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market , just like other citizens of the European Union .
this certainly does not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse .
a recent study , carried out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund , however , has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in Sweden .
I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm , the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions .
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week .
it is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures .
thank you for your reply .
I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission . instead of 2004 , it should , of course , be 1 July 2000 .
I have some sympathy with the Commission &apos;s standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally .
such a rule is only normal .
nevertheless , I should like to ask two questions : are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the Swedish Government about extending the derogations , for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogations ?
my second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol .
this may , of course , be seen as an issue concerning the internal market , but also as a public health matter for the whole EU .
what are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission &apos;s work ?
a Europe-wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market . it also has important implications for public health .
if we had considered these aspects in their overall context , then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden .
may I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follows ?
firstly , Finland and Denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 2003 .
these countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003 .
however , in the case of Sweden , the situation is different .
in 1995 , a five-year derogation period was decided upon , which is now lapsing .
I have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period .
secondly , the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way .
I can inform Mr Andersson that I will leave for Stockholm on Monday , 6 March , in order to talk to Minister Ringholm , to members of the Swedish parliament , and , if necessary , also to the Prime Minister or other ministers , in order to continue discussions on this matter . I am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in Sweden regarding this issue .
thirdly , I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important .
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated , namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions , the consumption of alcohol will remain the same .
the question is then , of course , where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers ?
the answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves , and as Mr Andersson knows , this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity .
well now , Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol .
but in that case , not only Sweden , but all EU countries , should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol .
we can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States .
Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then &apos; prohibition &apos; .
he will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States , where , eventually , prohibition was withdrawn .
all this means that we need to protect health , of course , but not by banning alcohol , because that does not work .
Mr President , the question at issue is the income from the Swedish alcohol monopoly and when the Swedish Government says that it must cover health costs , then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves , with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal .
my question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget .
I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter .
I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in Sweden goes back to the year 1638 and that since then , the sale of alcohol products has accounted for a significant portion of the state &apos; s tax revenue .
as is known , this has led to a state monopoly in Sweden which , in itself , is at odds with Union legislation .
Mr President , I listened with interest to the Commissioner &apos;s reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market .
I wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French Government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France &apos;s Loi et Vin , which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in France ?
can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice ?
I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member , since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission .
the Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice .
my reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now , but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks .
I ask for the Member &apos;s understanding for this small delay in the Commission &apos;s decision .
Commissioner , do you have any reason , on public health grounds , for a difference in the taxation rates on , for example , Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague &apos;s Bavarian beer ?
can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe ?
the matter of excise taxes , to which the honourable Member is referring , is the prerogative of the Member State concerned .
the Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products .
towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States .
it will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs , which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States .
for example - I believe the honourable Member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in France , whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom .
that leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom .
the question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax .
the Commission has no means of influence here .
in the case of Sweden , the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol .
although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol .
there is , of course , elasticity of demand , in this case a price elasticity of demand .
I am not sure exactly what it is , but it is not zero , therefore it must have some effect .
my question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis , but I would like to press the point further .
granted , as you say , that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States , nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle .
may I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market .
we need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products .
if one looks at petrol , for example , one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland , and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany .
that is indeed distortion of the internal market .
if I had my way , I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe .
as a result , smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another .
but I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way .
this is an area of unanimity , as Mr MacCormick knows , and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes , it will not happen .
once again , towards the end of this year , the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes , and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine , although we do not know how much tax is put on it , but I suppose it is a lot .
since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed , Questions 55 to 114 will be replied to in writing .
that concludes Questions to the Commission .
( the sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Community policy in the field of water ( continuation )
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy .
Mr President , the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but , in general terms , it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease .
to this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East .
in fact , a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania , threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia .
I understand that Mrs Wallström , whose presence here tonight I appreciate , is going to visit the area .
I believe that no country , no government and , of course , no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin .
the development of this directive has been difficult and complex , involving diverse interests and divided opinions .
I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature , Mrs Lienemann , has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions , and has succeeded to a large extent .
however , it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations .
I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain .
the Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity , century after century , year after year , day after day , and is still doing so today .
therefore , it seems essential to us that the directive complies , in practice , with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions .
in accordance with this principle , the Spanish delegation of the European People &apos; s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 ( Recital 21 ) , 13 and 49 ( Article 11 ( d ) ) , since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States , that is , the regulation of water resources .
it would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions , given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests .
we also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010 .
we must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which , at the same time , safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development .
I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero , or close to zero , degree of pollution .
in no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution .
we will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions .
I hope that , once again , this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity , seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations , the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is a very important directive .
its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems .
the public must have a right to clean water .
it is important not only for the environment but also for public health .
I am not speaking so much for myself , as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home .
we must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality .
action must get under way immediately .
we cannot afford to waste time .
it is important that the timetable is an ambitious one .
in my opinion , the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then .
it is a question of doing what is technically possible ; obviously it is not possible to do anymore , but we must be sufficiently ambitious .
I would like to comment on one issue , which was spoken about earlier .
I believe the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water .
this is not merely a problem for Spain ; it is one for the Nordic countries , and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters , when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , congratulations , Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work .
water and air surround us everywhere .
we share them with everyone on this earth .
water is a prerequisite for human life .
and there are more and more of us in the world .
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal .
nothing could be further from the truth !
it is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so , too , the conditions for life .
it is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources .
I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order .
Mr President , we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann , the targets it sets and the directive under discussion .
however , we should look a little more closely at some points .
for example , a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes , which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments , and which , of course , are a great risk to ground waters , water tables and surface waters .
I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place , the specifications common to us all must be very stringent .
but the key issue is , in my opinion , planning how to restore water tables , the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes , which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind .
I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding , because , at the end of the day , that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy .
Mr President , here we have what is basically a good measure .
it sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management .
its aim of good-quality water for drinking , for wildlife , the environment and economic purposes is right .
the prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood .
we have three outstanding problems .
the first is the transfer of water between basin areas .
that is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain , Ireland and the United Kingdom .
amendments Nos 4 . 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed , be that arid areas or urban areas .
secondly , we have to have realistic targets , but targets nevertheless .
looking at Amendment No 7 , for example , which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances , you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic .
also , some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English , that is quite a meaningless term .
we need to look very carefully at those .
the concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better .
thirdly , I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky .
Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky , which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream .
some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk .
we must make sure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in &quot; high quality &quot; , which means it must use good , Scottish peat water .
that is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole .
turning to the report , we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata , or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation .
in that spirit , we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos .
river waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought .
finally , as regards the Council &apos; s allegation , which the Commission echoes , that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein , this is chicanery .
its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action , which during the directive &apos; s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business .
Mr President , first and foremost , I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment , both surface water and groundwater , is probably one of our most important duties of all .
that is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is , to a large degree , about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future .
we are all entitled to clean drinking water .
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann &apos; s work on this matter .
it has been a huge task , and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann &apos; s amendments . these are all improvements to the common position .
moreover , I shall only highlight the most important ones .
first and foremost , I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years .
I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position .
and , finally , I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we , as consumers , are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and , at the same time , obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which , I believe , there is broad agreement .
in this regard , too , I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate .
finally , I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges , emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but , at the same time , be set a target , namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero .
if this cannot be adopted as the objective , then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020 .
I think that Mrs Lienemann &apos; s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive .
the second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely ; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in Romania must feature in today &apos; s discussions and also more generally when we ponder the environmental dimension of Union enlargement .
first of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act .
the cyanide and heavy metals in the rivers are gruesome examples of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterways for decades to come .
the event proves that in some countries applying for EU membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the EU .
the Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water .
with regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean , natural groundwater .
in Finland surface waters are very clean .
the production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves .
the process does not require a chemical sewage plant .
the directive must not be allowed to endanger this work .
Deviating from the Council &apos; s common position , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water .
this would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed .
the ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts .
the work should , of course , be regulated and subject to license in the future too , but the same rules cannot apply to , for example , Finland and Greece , which suffers from drought .
Mr President , Commissioner , water is a precious natural asset , a vital necessity , and it is our duty to protect it .
I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union , which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources , and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view .
I must say , however , that , there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water , and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way .
there are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water , and that should be taken into account by this directive .
in recent years , climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain .
we agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled , whose aim is to improve it .
however , we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water , granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers .
in addition , amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage .
the issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought , I think , to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it .
as for the time scale demanded for the directive &apos; s implementation , it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive &apos; s implementation will take time and considerable resources .
in spite of these remarks however , I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained .
Mr President , Commissioner , the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans , comprehensive information and hearing rights , and close cooperation between the Member States , to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants .
and considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind , I am pleased to be present here today , and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us .
however , it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted .
I would still like to highlight this point though : this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State &apos; s territory against its will .
and by way of reaffirming this once again , I have introduced an amendment - gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members - and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow .
it is all about making it clear that water - and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today - is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual EU Member States and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it .
I am aware , and the previous speaker highlighted this , that there are States in the European Union that have problems with water .
I believe that every one of us , in every country , could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way .
this applies to every country .
but only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources , when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries , only then , in my view , should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage .
Mr President , Commissioner , we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading .
however , I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality , it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings .
firstly , I believe that this directive is excessively tough , simplistic and reductionist .
in many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done , although I know that this is not pleasant .
it is not a question of having much tougher regulations , because in many cases the problems concern management . it is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative , the complications of which we are all well aware of .
this is a reductionist directive . we cannot lump countries with navigable rivers together with countries which lack water , where great cracks open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of 55ºC or 60ºC in the sun .
I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court . this issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission .
in the same way , this damage and these tragedies which are happening , as in Romania , are not the problem of the legislative , but of the executive and of the governments .
furthermore , it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas , climatic diversity , desert areas and arid areas .
that is how the common position has been worded .
the same can be said with regard to transfers .
transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth , of solidarity between peoples and territories , because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less .
lastly , I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact .
it is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but , on environmental questions , we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people , how many farmers , could be ruined by having to pay the costs .
some kind of study has been done which has not even been read , and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice , rather than just laying down doctrine .
Mr President , through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union .
it is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface , ground , transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and , in our case in Ireland , cross-border level .
Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments .
a 25-year roll-out for legislation , for example , is hardly acceptable .
we have no difficulty with the &quot; polluter pays &quot; principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial , commercial and agricultural level .
however , I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right , this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge , a quota per household for drinking , cooking and sanitation .
we must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly .
the introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977 .
meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts , to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements .
the whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU .
water is a scarce and precious natural resource .
ideally , I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges .
that would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges , with each Member States drawing up its own scheme , so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected .
if Amendment No 45 does not fall , I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services .
all legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance .
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world .
Mr President , Commissioner , at this point in the debate I am going to insist on certain aspects which , from an agronomic point of view , and since I come from a southern country , I consider to be absolutely essential to this directive .
these include , for example , costs and transfers .
with regard to costs , I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about .
are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water ?
are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks ?
are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services ?
or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs ?
all these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector .
transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas .
is the Commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in Europe ?
they already existed in ancient times : they had them in Roman times , although on a smaller scale .
one of the most significant transfers - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which has been in use for many years , almost 30 years , has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year .
the largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200 .
we cannot be accused of bad management .
is the Commissioner aware that , of this 263 hm3 , we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante , 30 for water supplies in the area of the Júcar , 7 for supplies in the southern area of the Júcar and the rest in the Segura , equally divided between supplies and irrigation ?
we are not doing a bad job of management .
we cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it .
I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies , because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive .
take good note : in this diverse Europe , which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation , we have to find diverse solutions , not single solutions .
I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission , the Council and this House so that , when voting , they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required .
Commissioner , Andalusia is not Lapland .
. ( SV ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I want , of course , to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and , above all , the rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive .
water is one of our most important natural resources , as many speakers have already said .
an ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe .
water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office .
I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament .
many of them are based upon the very constructive , informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading .
most of Parliament &apos; s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious .
the Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments , either in their entirety , partially or in principle .
many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary .
with a view to these forthcoming negotiations , I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position .
firstly , I should like to mention some of my most important arguments .
we now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention .
rather than make these objectives legally binding , we must consider their political nature .
this is also reflected in many of Parliament &apos; s amendments .
where water charges are concerned , the present directive will constitute Europe &apos; s water policy for the next three decades .
it is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way .
it sounds good , saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge .
but water is not free of charge , any more than houses or food are free of charge .
it is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource .
I also want to add that , when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities , I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules . I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances .
in the course of the debate , many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed .
I just want to emphasise this further .
it is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them .
this is also expressed in Recital 14 .
allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that , in common with my Scottish colleague , he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again .
we have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production .
allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail .
limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives .
I am glad to see that Parliament &apos; s amendments have focused upon this .
the Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text .
we must , however , keep to their precise scope and content .
as I said , their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character .
it would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable .
it must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables .
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6 , 10 , 14 , 24 , 58 , 60 and 88 .
the Commission cannot , on the other hand , approve Amendment No 19 , in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR .
the Commission &apos; s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances , and so no definition is needed .
even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106 , these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR , and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments .
the Commission can also , in principle , approve Amendment No 60 , according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission &apos; s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances .
Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed .
this would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot , therefore , be approved .
the desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved .
lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances .
I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector .
the Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive .
I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services .
I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way .
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs .
I can therefore partly , and in principle , approve Amendments Nos 43-46 , together with Amendment No 85 .
I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector .
this would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured .
I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105 , which is in line with the Commission &apos; s original proposal .
I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources .
we are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals .
this must not , however , be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution .
we intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question .
I agree with Parliament that the common position &apos; s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced .
the same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years .
Amendment No 28 , cancelling the third extension period , is an important step in the right direction .
this proposal can therefore be approved .
a period of ten years , as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26 , among others , is , on the other hand , too short .
I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided .
the proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water .
this applies to Amendments Nos 6 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 78 , 80 , 102 and 104 .
these Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found .
to comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29 , to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension , would be going too far , and these cannot be approved .
another important area is protection of the groundwater .
we need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution .
we also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring .
the most important parts of Parliament &apos; s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle .
the new definition in Amendment No 72 is , however , too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose .
I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution .
Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater .
the proposal cannot therefore be approved .
the Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality .
instead , we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area .
the good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled .
this part of Amendment No 41 cannot , therefore , be approved .
the Commission appreciates Parliament &apos; s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role .
this approach and its scope , which the Commission can in principle approve , are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47 .
in order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality , we wish , however , to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision .
the transfer of water is already covered by controls , but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer .
these parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can , therefore , be approved .
it is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted .
the proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned .
these parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot , therefore , be approved .
the Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal .
to summarise , the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments , either in their entirety , partially or in principle .
finally , I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views .
important progress has been made , and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions .
a number of obstacles remain , but I am convinced that , as the legislative work progresses , we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of .
Parliament &apos; s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious , European water policy for the next three decades .
I would like to hear the Commissioner &apos;s view on Amendment No 45 .
I may have missed it in the list she gave out .
. I accept that .
thank you , Mrs Wallström .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m .
financial instrument for the environment ( LIFE )
the next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A4-0014 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a financial instrument for the environment ( LIFE ) ( Rapporteur : Mrs Lienemann ) .
rapporteur .
( FR ) Mr President , we have already had the opportunity , at the first reading , to examine this report and I was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this House .
it must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the Community budget .
Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement .
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular .
we are well aware that , in the European Union , a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation . with LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility , the validity of the objectives of these directives , and their capacity to be implemented .
and , for want of appropriations , we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop .
but we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union &apos; s financial programmes and instruments .
I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget .
let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations , not a vast sum in the Community budget , and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus .
I feel , at any rate , that for the ultimate application of LIFE , at least , there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment .
let me conclude with the matter of our institutions &apos; way of working .
I would , however , like to point out that the Council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date .
as for us , we our bound by the terms of the texts : a maximum of four months .
we meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others , because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time .
I think Parliament often protests about this method , not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council , and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs , since , the truth is , it is something of a tradition , which the Council has kept going for a long time .
but I should like to stress the fact that , on this issue of the environment , the budget issue is a central one and Parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal .
I therefore hope , firstly , that our fellow Members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the Council and the Commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other .
Mr President , it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the Council and the Commission , and I will refer to this later on .
it is equally true , however , that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering LIFE I and LIFE II .
it is better firstly because the framework proposal made LIFE I more rigorous , more transparent and more rational .
secondly , it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations , which were advocated by the European Parliament at first reading .
specifically , these are : to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects , and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination . this is one of the aims that LIFE-Environment must achieve .
thirdly , the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of LIFE-Environment &apos; s priorities is an extremely positive step .
in spite of all its virtues though , LIFE III &apos; s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument &apos; s impact , which is its budget .
by persisting with their proposal of EUR 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004 , and by refusing to accept the European Parliament &apos; s proposal of EUR 850 million , the Commission and the Council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they introduced , and rightly so , for other measures in LIFE III .
we want the Commission and the Council to know that we will not give up trying to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument .
we have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice .
firstly , LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union .
there is no other such policy .
secondly , LIFE is an instrument that has already produced good results , and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation .
thirdly , the LIFE budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand .
fourthly , as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE , it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget .
this means that approving the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend .
our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue , however .
climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House .
we therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water , as well as for reducing greenhouse gases , they should be adopted .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , LIFE is the European Union &apos; s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment .
that explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions , ambitions for which , of course , there is a price .
obviously , the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III .
the common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004 . this is not enough .
the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million .
we therefore support Mrs Lienemann &apos; s amendment which observes that the allocation for LIFE was not increased when the Union was last enlarged , without even mentioning the next batch of new arrivals .
the amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure .
quite the opposite , it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded .
a drop in the ocean , I might say , in comparison with Europe &apos; s structural policies .
the environment is still the poor relation in the European budget , even though it is primarily an investment .
an investment in natural resources , of course , but also in employment , since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs , as shown particularly by the great success of LIFE , a success with NGOs , businesses , local authorities and third countries .
more than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998 .
a success which Parliament wishes and intends to see perpetuated , and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the LIFE project .
in matters of the environment , investment and ambition come in a variety of forms , and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term .
this is the price of the future of generations to come .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that , as far as the Council is concerned , the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE .
I shall therefore reiterate that , as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly , LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union &apos; s policy on the environment .
this instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe , which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States .
this financial instrument is , furthermore , deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations .
that is why , ladies and gentlemen , I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE .
through the associations , then , LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly , and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community .
several million NGO members - millions , I say - recognise in LIFE the Union &apos; s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage .
LIFE is , moreover , the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot , pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds , and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States .
I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies .
this is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States , a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds .
let us not forget that , to date , LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum , i.e. scarcely 0.1 % of the budget of the European Union .
for the record , the budget for agriculture , which has a real impact on the environment , amounts , as we all know , to EUR 37 billion .
the first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those .
Mr President , the European Union environmental programme , to which a considerable amount ( EUR 613 million ) has been allocated , gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds .
a financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective , and this is not the case for the following reasons : poorly defined selection criteria , dubious uncoordinated operations , assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy .
we are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows .
firstly , to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to LIFE funds exclusively to public bodies , subsequently , following invitation to tender , to entrust the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations .
it is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions , since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions .
it is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100 % public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership , even under cover of environmental protection .
secondly , to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of LIFE funds , in order to rule our any suspicions of clientelism or ostracism .
thirdly , to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite .
for example , the LIFE-Nature project in France , at Grand-Lieu Lake , planned without any coordination , led to a real ecological disaster , the de-silting operation which was carried out without regard for French law on the subject caused significant silting of the Acheneau , a water course located downstream , destroying spawning beds , filling wetlands , and who knows what else .
the silt was in fact shifted 3 kilometres , at a cost of FF 6 million , the cure being worse than the disease , and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site .
result : a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself .
this is the sort of thing that we want to avoid .
four , to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee , at least one Member per political group .
what could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for ?
Fifthly , to publish an annual scientific , technical and financial assessment of LIFE operations carried out .
six , to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis .
seven , to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency : for example , in reforestation following storm damage , or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick , etc .
here , Mrs Lienemann , Mr President , we are putting forward here a practical proposal , a common sense proposal , easy to implement , likely to limit local conflicts and to vindicate the proper use of public monies , before increasing the LIFE budget line by as much as 40 % !
Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has carried out , and also the Commission - why not ? - because this report , this position , generally improves on the texts in force .
furthermore , it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent .
I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission , since the evaluation , control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects .
however , I would like to insist on certain points .
firstly , its continuity , which , in principle , I am not questioning .
secondly , the financial contributions .
sadly , only 7.2 % of the projects requested receive funds .
of the EUR 1 919 million requested , only EUR 784 million have been granted .
now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences .
Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million , but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million .
Commissioner , our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas , while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing .
is this not a contradiction ?
let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves ?
why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us , but rather expect the usual people , the ones who live there all year , to pay for it and maintain it ?
Commissioner , we must be consistent .
the cost of maintaining the environment , which we all enjoy , must be met by all of us , and the LIFE programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective .
Mr President , LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy , both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries .
on the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years , an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument .
the funding of activities for the implementation , adaptation and development of Community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policies , particularly ones that contribute towards sustainable development , are central elements of the regulation we are to vote upon .
an important element of LIFE-Nature , which mainly concerns the realisation of the Natura 2000 network , is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities , so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity .
in the second , LIFE-Environment strand , which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies , the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed .
as regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years , I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann .
unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection , there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years , and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies .
besides , we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries .
what has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary has been instructive .
consequently , I consider that support for environmental action under the LIFE financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the Community &apos; s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment , ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening .
two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic .
so I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue .
for five years , I have been the representative of the Committee on the Environment in a regional organisation , which assuredly does not have Parliament &apos; s broad perspective .
the environment is in a parlous state .
like a number of previous speakers , I , too , wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects , which , in my view , should be incorporated into the pubic domain .
as regards funding , EUR 613 million is not enough . even EUR 850 million is not enough .
at the end of August 1999 , I took part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it was said that EUR 2 million , or ITL 4 000 billion , should go towards eliminating or , at any rate , reducing smoking .
however , the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking .
EUR 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me , is not enough , in practical terms , to allow any type of project to be carried out .
in many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established .
but creating parks with very limited financial resources , without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual .
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , ever since the beginning of 1999 , discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE .
I would again thank the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter .
as a result of this , I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
the Commission welcomes , above all , Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 13 , which apply to the Committee procedures .
in these cases , Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position .
the Commission can , in principle , also approve Amendment No 4 which ought , however , to be introduced into another place in the text .
with regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6 , I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water , together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect , are to a large degree covered by LIFE .
the Commission nonetheless considers that , if this is stated separately , then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas .
there is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research , Technical Development and Demonstration .
the present programme &apos; s key measures - water quality , tomorrow &apos; s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions .
where the question of the budget is concerned , I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position .
I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential .
this instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget .
the amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not , however , tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000 .
allow me also to add that , if the budget is increased , greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with .
account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure .
at this stage , the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position .
with regard to Amendment No 3 , which we did not approve at first reading , I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives , conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid .
it is therefore meaningless , and often impossible , directly to transfer projects from LIFE to other instruments .
if other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project , more resources would , moreover , be required than are available in the present situation .
now that the Commission has to consider carefully what resources are required for each activity , this is an example of the kind of activity we ought to avoid : one that is inessential but demanding in terms of resources .
nor can the Commission approve Amendment No 14 , which is contrary to the Commission &apos; s right of initiative .
with regard to the discussion concerning the deadline , I want to say that the final date for beginning to implement LIFE - 31 March 2000 , as set in the common position - must now be moved forward .
the date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted .
finally , I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community &apos; s environmental policy .
Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument .
I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible , especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries , especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE .
thank you , Mrs Wallström .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
modernising social protection
the next item is the report ( A5-0033 / 2000 ) , by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 347 - C5-0253 / 1999 - 1999 / 2182 ( COS ) &#93; .
Mr President , the issue of social security systems is an important one .
this is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU .
the basis is monetary cooperation , which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy .
it is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems .
these areas are mutually dependent upon one another .
economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment .
it also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision .
but the reverse is also the case : a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth .
in other words , social security is a factor of production .
social security systems differ from one EU country to another .
this is largely due to historical factors .
we are now faced with a number of common challenges , however ; demographic development , for example , which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate .
the labour market is also changing .
women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers .
another challenge is presented by technical development .
we must meet these challenges together .
the Commission &apos; s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared , a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced .
what is more , the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment .
this is good , but it is not enough .
we propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process .
clear guidelines and indicators are required . at the same time , the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans .
we are creating a common model , but retaining the principle of subsidiarity .
this social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period .
Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group , but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on .
like the work on employment , the Commission &apos; s proposal is founded upon four pillars .
these are : to make the systems employment-friendly ; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term ; to promote social integration ; and to guarantee sustainable , high-quality health and medical care .
all this is important .
in our report , we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area .
equality has no pillar of its own .
there , it is mainstreaming which applies .
all four pillars should reflect aspects of equality .
this is something we have borne in mind .
we are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect , for example , that there should be a transition to individualised social security systems ; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems ; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life ; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living .
these proposals favour women especially .
parallel to this European strategy of social convergence , a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required , together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees , accompanied by a concrete timetable .
we expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme .
social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union , partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping .
the Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement .
we have had a constructive discussion in the Committee .
we had a lot of amendments , but succeeded in agreeing upon a report .
now , the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen .
this indicates that we have a broad consensus .
a number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading , and these I shall reject .
I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members , because I do not think that these add anything to the report .
on the other hand , my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
I think this proposal is a good one .
certainly , it resembles Amendment No 1 , but Amendment No 14 is better .
finally , I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade .
the EU is also a union for employment and social justice .
in creating a citizens &apos; Europe , social policy has an important role to play .
by means of this report , Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society .
we hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy .
the Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Andersson , very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion .
in the capacity of coordinator of the European People &apos; s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into .
I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report .
the goal of the Commission &apos; s notification of June 1999 , on which the Andersson report is based , is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection .
key sub-goals are : promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income ; secondly , safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable ; thirdly , promoting social integration and fourthly , guaranteeing affordable , first-rate health protection .
Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals .
I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification , for these four points are , in fact , to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought .
the Commission &apos; s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence .
macro-economic policy , employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together .
the Commission has recognised this interrelatedness .
it is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is , of course , underpinned by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy .
these aspects are very much interconnected .
it is , therefore , surprising that this topic has , to date , not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission &apos; s notification constitutes a break-through in a way .
it brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break-through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon .
we should , of course , not get overly excited about it .
it marks the beginning , rather than the end , of a process .
some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue .
but it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion .
the issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another .
the challenges are different .
the levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling gently but to make steady progress nonetheless .
in this way , we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges .
the majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen .
the funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape ; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report .
it is a report which tries to give direction .
there are , however , one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific .
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this .
but that does not take away from the fact that the report &apos; s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon .
I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way , Lisbon will turn out to be a success .
if it is not adopted , Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past .
as far as this is concerned , the report , albeit a component , may well be the key component of Lisbon , because it is really innovative , while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before .
all in all , I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report .
I hope that Europe , in terms of social protection , will make a step forward , taking into account subsidiarity , for without subsidiarity , this would not be possible .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , like my fellow MEP , Bartho Pronk , please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and , in particular , to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report .
Commissioner , the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance .
there have been times within this Parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward .
it is also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit , which intends to find out how we can put economic growth , employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society .
within my group , it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon .
my group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that , in fact , a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000 .
however , we , the Parliament and , in particular , the group of the Social Democrats , want Lisbon to go one step further now .
it is of great importance that , in our fellow MEP &apos; s report , this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence , based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy , that is to say it should encompass common goals , guidelines , national action plans and performance evaluations .
we believe that this course of action is ambitious , yet achievable .
Needless to say , it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level .
the financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this , and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda , and why , in fact , scenarios such as Danny Peters &apos; thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground .
but this new course of action is very exciting .
the employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary , for our social security systems are facing the same challenges , and in an EMU era , social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition .
but let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group : social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation .
they can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation .
I think that it also a good thing if , moreover , the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001 .
I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group &apos; s idea and we hope , Commissioner , that we can also count on your support .
finally , we urge the European Parliament , both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process .
the success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support .
these are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them . having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from .
we now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets , which is a problem for many Member States .
if reforms are not got under way , we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy , and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security .
it is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda .
in the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU , we often use the expression social convergence .
as liberals , we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies .
it is not , therefore , about harmonisation but about common objectives .
it is , of course , a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy .
we have different traditions and there are differences in culture and , in spite of there being many points of similarity , there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned . it is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern .
national policy is , of course , subject to a number of common parameters . that is the case with minimum social entitlements , which are established by treaty .
it is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements . it applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies ; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation .
so coordination and cooperation are facts of life . but convergence should be about goals , not means .
I should also like to thank the rapporteur , Jan Andersson , for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report .
I can support the report , but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste .
I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems , if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient , or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries .
I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission &apos; s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly , and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold .
dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended , but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same . there should be room for a multiplicity of solutions .
Mr President , Commissioner , with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security , I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me .
I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier .
this seems to be a good thing and useful .
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication , namely the strategic approach .
we therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved .
we would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled . on the one hand , it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg , but we also think it is important , as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker , that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios , such as sole traders , etc .
we nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found .
the first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security , which , we hope , will be replaced by high-level convergence .
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union .
it appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments , in fact , the majority of them , appear to be downward adjustments , the remainder being improvements .
the lion &apos; s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans : eleven restrictions and two improvements .
in the case of unemployment benefits , we came across six restrictions and five improvements .
the reasons for adjustments are , for example , to improve employment , reduce social security expenditure , but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria .
policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries .
the highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries .
all in all , both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole .
this is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches .
to use a figure of speech , cappuccino is not always good for us .
Mr President , I would , in turn , like to congratulate both the Commission , for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security , and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled .
the European Union &apos; s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy .
so far , social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources .
but under the influence of the free movement of employees , of the internal market and of the euro , the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated .
this has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent .
cross-border workers , employees on secondment and migrating employees , as well as job-seekers , students on placement and other students , experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement . this is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection .
in fact , the same phenomenon occurs in tax law .
in order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping , the Commission has , in my opinion , developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention .
on the one hand , binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand , programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion .
based on a number of recommendations , reports and communications , the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials .
both proposals have already been accepted by the Council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time , with knowledge of all facts and / or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union .
indeed , expansion , globalisation , a sharp increase in the ageing population , individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable .
denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection .
with regard to eurosceptics and nationalists , I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection .
indeed , if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition , this would also harm social protection as a production factor .
and less social protection means less purchasing power , fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees .
in respect of the super-Europeans , I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable .
the discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions , rightful claimants , revenue or benefits , etc . it is thus impossible to bring all States into line .
the path which the Commission is walking is , in fact , obvious .
it has the advantage of clarity , and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid , comparative indicators and put forward recommendations .
I endorse this view .
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter .
Mr President , Mr Andersson &apos; s report contains a lot that is of interest .
unfortunately , what is most interesting is that the report , which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy , instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere .
social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States .
even though the socialists , now that there are so many social democratic governments , talk much less about unemployment than they used to , the unemployment in question is still high , and this in spite of the trade boom .
something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody .
social policy must facilitate employment , creating incentives for employers and employees to , respectively , provide and accept jobs .
Mr Andersson &apos; s report demands social convergence , that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the EU .
the EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria , which would be binding and of real effect .
Mr Andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination , that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere .
the EU should also , on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds , table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States .
the EU should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created , whatever that may mean .
it is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference .
those structural problems which make unemployment higher in Europe than in the United States will become even greater .
there is no need at all for supranationalism in this area .
the Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere , each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences .
it is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU .
Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too .
it is obvious , however , that these countries , impoverished within a Communist economic system , cannot cope with a social policy like , for example , Sweden &apos; s .
talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant States are concerned .
Mr President , as others have done , I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced .
he has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is , by any definition , a thorny issue , not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State .
I also welcome the Commission &apos;s communication .
it was slow in coming but well worth waiting for .
it could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe , providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it .
we can , and must , take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century , a century which is globalising fast .
I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world .
to be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy , our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense , are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole .
we have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative , has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens .
this is not an option for us any more .
it is an imperative .
European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings .
we do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life .
what it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States .
that is not what we want to do in Europe .
we have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things .
but we have to grasp the tools to do that .
I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as proposed by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is one of the social areas to which the European Union ought to pay much more attention .
macroeconomic policies , the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people &apos; s lives , specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes , particularly of the minimum pensions , and through fighting social exclusion .
this situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn , is the lowest in the whole of Europe .
therefore , while the Commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality , with employee rights , which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid , public social protection system , we harbour serious doubts as to its position .
although the Andersson report has gathered some positive proposals , including some that we put forward ourselves , we are still critical of some of the bases for the Commission &apos; s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection .
Mr President , in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses , one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands .
as the UK business grew , we invested in more people , as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery .
the simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison .
I am in favour of social protection , I am in favour of the original Commission document , but I do not want to see people priced out of jobs because social protection costs become unrealistically high .
that is why in committee I proposed some form of business impact assessment , so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account , and the EPP-DE Group supported this amendment .
but I must record that other groups , led by the PSE Group , guided by my countryman , Stephen Hughes , voted this out .
I accept that Mr Andersson &apos;s report is very well-intentioned , and I respect him for the work he has done , but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the EU .
this would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world .
I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal , which was very well-balanced , stand unamended .
Mr President , we are unable to vote for this report .
the European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe .
social rights should determine economic choices , and not the other way around .
this is why , when it comes to social protection , we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale : broad economic guidelines , then convergence criteria and , finally , social issues , dealt with as the last resort .
the European Union should proclaim one general principle , to wit , that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted .
any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator .
in order to strengthen the funding of social security systems , we need a policy of general wage increase , the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State .
in order to fight poverty , entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights .
finally , in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity , the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system .
I sincerely hope , in conclusion , that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes .
for millions of people the situation is too tragic for that .
Mr President , Commissioner , the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one . just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable .
the labour market and social protection are , in fact , two sides of the same coin , that require harmonised policies and rules .
if the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment , flexibility and salary discipline , then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function , and vice versa .
until recently , the European countries fixed , it could be said in an autarkic way , the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets .
budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability .
with the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency , budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness .
the structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot , therefore , be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade .
that being the case , in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union , and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level , it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria , the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks .
and therein lies the paradox .
political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems .
but , at the same time , the single currency and the absence of labour mobility , as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy , force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare , in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels .
hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence , benchmarking , modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions .
that is something we would do well to recognise .
Mr President , unlike several of those who have spoken in today &apos; s debate , I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report , one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission &apos; s communications .
in particular , I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model &apos; s approach , which is one based on solidarity .
I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping , together with the right to a basic level of social security , the goal of social convergence , and , in particular , the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy .
I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union , and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state , model .
all in all , though , I deem this report to be worthwhile .
Mr President , I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection , which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe .
this message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson .
Europe , the European Union , although it is very strong in economic and political terms , will remain shaky , weak and limited , perhaps inadequate , if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view .
I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it , but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged .
bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income , I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union .
let us not forget that , in 1999 , 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate .
in social terms , it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience , as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain .
we must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes , mergers , take-overs , new technologies etc .
what is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs , for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity , because sometimes , as the title of the film states , the postman always rings twice .
in my humble opinion , it is the responsibility of all European , national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion .
it seems to me , Commissioner , that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work , which is the reason why there is broader agreement , and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution .
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said .
first , I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled : &quot; the future of social protection &quot; and there have been statements from the European Parliament , those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk .
today , we have the statement by Mr Andersson .
I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection .
the second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate .
you know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level , but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council , there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience , as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States .
the next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken .
as you know , a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency , which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June .
the Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things : sustainable pension systems and social accession .
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group .
concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems , the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States , I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion .
of course , we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness , but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment .
I think the statement &apos; s content makes this clear .
ladies and gentlemen , the aim is that in the next year , and after a unanimous decision by the Council , we should progress to a first level of coordination , exchange of views , listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies .
as many of the speakers have said , I believe a first important step has been taken .
already at the Intergovernmental Conference , social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase , in which social policy will , to a large extent , become a European policy .
thank you , Mrs Diamantopoulou .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
WIPO treaty
Mr President , we are now taking a stance on an important issue , an international agreement , which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States .
in my own country , Sweden , one of our biggest export industries is affected , namely the music and sound recording industry .
it is about artists &apos; entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products .
it is about the WCT ( World Copyright Treaty ) and the WPPT ( World Performance and Phonograms Treaty ) .
without protection under intellectual property law , creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed .
Forgeries are big business .
it is estimated that , in Europe alone , income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy .
the problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry .
this is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party . this is the case , in spite of the fact that it is not the EU , but only the Member States , which belong to the organisation .
there exists a special clause which requires Parliament &apos; s assent in two cases .
with regard to the present agreement , both these conditions are fulfilled .
a new institution is being created , an assembly which , in the future , will monitor the agreement and its consequences .
the agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure .
Parliament must therefore give its assent , because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence .
the future will show whether it is right , by means of this new parliamentary assembly , to reduce the Commission &apos; s powers regarding these issues .
Parliament cannot , in any case , at present do anything about the matter .
the agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works .
it creates international legal protection in connection with distribution , sale , rental , public reproduction and the making available of works .
it also creates protection for software and databases .
there are problems regarding the term &quot; author &quot; .
for example , it has not been defined .
another issue , which is somewhat problematic , is that of intermediate storage .
this too has not been solved .
it is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition .
if no definitions are provided in questions such as this , it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world , with no uniformity of approach .
that would not be a good thing .
the question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved , too .
Parliament cannot change these details .
we can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands .
yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies .
both myself , as rapporteur , and the committee think we ought to say yes .
we have here an agreement which , in spite of its defects , constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright .
we have of course discussed at length whether Parliament and whether the EU should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law .
I think they should have .
however , there is still no Community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of designs , and there needs to be .
a European patent is in the offing , and that is a good thing .
now , the Union and the Member States are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law .
it is good for us that we have the power to do this , in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied .
in that way , we can act as a model for the applicant States .
we have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement .
I want to thank the Commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission &apos; s officials , which has been quite excellent .
finally , I also want to thank this Chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Cederschiöld , on her very serious work .
she has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation &apos; s treaties .
their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property .
it is a fact that the road has been a long one , mainly because of the legal problem that arose in connection with the extent to which the Community could be considered to have absolute competence in matters of intellectual property .
the problem has been overcome .
today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties : the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations , performances and phonograms .
as regards the first of these , it seems to provide an effective solution for the long-standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works , while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution , rental and the presentation of their works to the public .
as regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms , it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the Community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers , interpreters and artists for reproduction , distribution and rental to the public , and the right to fair remuneration for radio broadcasts .
in that context a noteworthy and important step forward is the treaty &apos; s treatment of the right of reproduction .
even though , as the Commission says , the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development , it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created , performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directives .
interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty , we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings , but also protection against copying , whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary , and protection against any other form of production .
it would be appropriate , however , for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future WIPO work or the work of other diplomatic conferences .
first , there is the right of distribution as referred to in Article 8 ( 1 ) .
the option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty &apos; s most negative points , since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right , a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists .
as regards rental rights , on interpretation of Article 9 , we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists , interpreters or performers , only if this is laid down by national legislation . I think this conflicts with Article 13 .
to conclude , I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights .
in the 21st century , the century of knowledge and the invisible economy , intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will , in many cases , be more important than traditional property .
we are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created , where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large .
Mr President , I should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which , nonetheless , concludes that , as a Community , our accession to these two WIPO treaties must not boil down to a mere institutional development , however important that may be , i.e. the opportunity for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together .
this ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe .
however , an objective is emerging behind this issue of Community accession , one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States , nonetheless , find too offensive .
this is the affirmation of a European cultural policy . in this connection , I expect our three institutions , Parliament , the Commission and the Council , to be in agreement .
cultural policy means , in particular , defending the role of the arts , recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards .
in addition , at a time when Europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights , there is an urgent need - as has just been pointed out several times - to define and redefine what exactly an author is .
our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them .
Mr President , Commissioner , the adoption of the WIPO agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society .
the agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright , and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights .
the entry into force of the treaties and their final form is , however , in addition to this recommendation , dependent on implementation by the parties themselves .
in the United States the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force , having been enacted into law by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by means of this legislation .
the EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO .
it is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system .
the opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted , and , furthermore , the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans .
the recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe , on the contrary .
Parliament &apos; s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old , in excess of 80 % market share to a new environment with rigid , excessive copyright regulations .
I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschiöld &apos; s recommendation , which is an excellent paper , but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed .
on one point of detail , I would like to thank Mrs Cederschiöld for having clarified , for example , the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion .
there is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies .
if these , which technically speaking are copies , were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason .
it would be as if the deliveryman had to pay a copyright fee whenever he carried a book to be read by the purchaser .
the real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user , the consumer .
the new operational environment is , above all , a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before .
it is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account .
Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation .
. ( NL ) Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out .
the Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively .
this is important .
it befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur .
I would like to present the Commission &apos; s conclusion to you without any further ado : it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and , therefore , with ratification by this Parliament .
I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties .
both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are , as such , a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome .
both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters , but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks .
the two Treaties explicitly permit the Community to become a party to the Treaties and to play an important role in managing them .
consequently , approval of the Treaties by the Community is of major importance , because it illustrates that the Community sets great store by intellectual property rights .
in addition , assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the European Union &apos; s role in terms of copyright .
at international level , there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly .
these have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States , including the United States .
the entry into force of treaties largely depends on the European Union , because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect , and these acts that are signed by the European Union and the Member States , including associated countries , are of vital importance in order to reach this number .
the developing countries , too , expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide .
in this context , Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society , which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999 .
this directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the WIPO Treaties .
the European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300 ( 3 ) .
it is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world , in the form of this recommendation .
in a nutshell , I would like to reiterate the Commission &apos; s conclusion here : it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a.m .
( the sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m. )
adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
the Minutes of yesterday &apos; s sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
Mr President , I see in the Minutes that two Members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to Strasbourg on Monday .
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam &apos; s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled .
we were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport .
we were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival .
in fact , it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport .
we finally got here , on Monday at 8.30 p.m. , after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling .
this sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless .
if the French Government insists that we continue to meet in Strasbourg , it could at least ensure , where flights are diverted to Basle , that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted passengers , otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business .
I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes .
Mr President , I was booked on the same flight and I am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was KLM , our national airline company .
I hope that next time , also if any other airline company is involved , things will run more smoothly .
( the Minutes were approved )
Mr President , I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today &apos; s agenda . we decided on Monday that the Council &apos; s statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention was to be postponed .
I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today , and not about the Geneva Convention .
this item has been postponed until the next part-session in March .
it was erroneously included in today &apos; s agenda .
Mr Swoboda , I can confirm what you have just said and there is , in fact , a printing error .
the document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies , because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate .
Mr President , I just want to say that , as I was walking in this morning , I noticed two people smoking outside the Hemicycle .
the smell is absolutely disgusting !
can you please do something about it ?
I cannot do anything about it myself , but you are quite right . we need a quick way of educating people , including those who do not obey the rules decided upon in this House .
regarding the problems caused by air travel delays , perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching Strasbourg for the present part-session should form a small group - although I am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered .
coherence of EU policies with development
the next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development .
Mr President , it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency , particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future , given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level .
the subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today , is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy .
the consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets .
a serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged , which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments , which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies .
we will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas :
firstly , there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players , by which I mean donors , requiring greater coordination , greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies ; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems .
at the same time , however , there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate , particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems , together with a need to focus special attention on these countries &apos; own policies for reducing poverty .
the second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development .
this means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy , but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance , trade and investment . furthermore , this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries &apos; own policies .
a third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives .
since 1995 , following a concerted international effort between the main donor states , involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD &apos; s Development Assistance Committee , it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies , both at national and international level .
as you will know , the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50 % by 2015 , by increasing compulsory schooling , by significantly reducing child mortality rates , and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective .
this would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world &apos; s population lives , and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people . this is an extraordinary state of affairs , which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively .
and that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise . particularly in recent years , development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter , and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership .
the concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here , as has the Bretton Woods system .
this new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context .
the Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies , and to create greater scope for coordination , in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system .
if we are to strengthen the European Union &apos; s role in international development policies , we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action .
firstly , we need to make the EU &apos; s development policy more effective .
as you know , an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies , and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency .
the main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues .
a second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more .
in this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost , as soon as possible , to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary .
the third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies , the central theme of today &apos; s debate .
as you know , a Council Resolution was approved , in June 1997 , under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports .
the first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999 , and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination , notably in the fields of peace building , food safety , fisheries and migration .
but as you will also be aware , we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence , together with the communication on development policy .
over the coming months , that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency , this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us .
it is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union . only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies .
but , quite apart from this , we would like to emphasise that , if we are to strengthen the coherence of European Union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the Union , we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the European Union itself .
by this I mean , of course , the internal dynamics of the European Union .
we know that the European Union has its own dynamics , which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam , which has reinforced its political dimension . this inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development .
we will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regards enlargement , to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies , and , as regards development in particular , to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective .
the second aspect that we need to consider , in relation to the coherence of policies , is development policy in the context of the Union &apos; s foreign policy .
there can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union &apos; s foreign policy .
it has to be said that , in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy , the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies .
the success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy , so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy .
in this context , we are convinced that we need to move away from the post ­ colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid . I say this because we know that , in Europe , development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States , in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states .
the third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States &apos; policy .
coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States &apos; policies with the European Union &apos; s development policy .
if we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies , it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy .
ladies and gentlemen , the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention , regarding development policy , is , of course , the Development Council . there have been discussions , especially in recent months , about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies .
as you know , there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF &apos; s financing , or rather lack of financing .
so without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which , although it directly impacts on the European Union &apos; s development policy , is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum , it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives .
the views of the European Parliament on this issue too , will certainly be both timely and welcome .
. let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries .
I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations .
I saw Member States working as a team , which was indeed a wonderful experience .
there was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over , not just because it was over , but because we all knew that we had achieved something together , the EU and the 71 ACP countries .
that is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation .
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement .
we explicitly address corruption ; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever .
we promote participatory approaches , we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the EU .
we refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies .
we base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country &apos;s needs , but also of its policy performance .
we create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector .
we rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming , allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme .
we decentralise administrative and , in some cases , financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective .
we improve the policy framework for trade and investment development .
we enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade , including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade .
after Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements .
let me turn to some of the more important points .
firstly the agreement on political issues .
the new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership , a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support .
secondly , a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights , democratic principles and the rule of law .
in comparison with the current procedure , the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process , with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation .
in cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements , measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified .
thirdly , the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption .
this is a real innovation , both in the EU / ACP context and in international relations in general .
this procedure will be applied , not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money , but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development .
it is thus not confined to EC activities .
this is a very important aspect , taking into account the fundability of public finances .
by adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement , the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors .
another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration .
we have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area .
this new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999 .
the European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions .
the agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives , in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU , and measures facilitating their integration .
we also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration .
the EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining , within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country , the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party .
this also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons .
these very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance .
the agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid .
we have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters .
we have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned .
negotiations will start no later than 2002 .
this two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries &apos; capacity to conduct trade negotiations .
a six-year period is programmed for these negotiations .
we will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways : firstly , through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and , secondly , by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums .
this approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime .
economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners .
domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred , all of which will boost the ACP countries &apos; competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy .
in addition , the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor .
they will lock in the economic reforms , just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties &apos; commitments under the agreements .
the rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction .
another important aspect is the improvement of the EU &apos; s trade regime for all least-developed countries , 39 of which are actually in the ACP group .
this process will take place in the coming five years so that , by 2005 , the LDCs &apos; exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market .
as regards the volume of the next EDF , the EU has made its financial proposal .
it is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective .
today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted .
the EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances , plus the new EDF resources , over a seven-year period , that is to say , before the entry into force of the next financial protocol .
this will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period .
we are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity , we are moving into a period of increased activity .
such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides .
there is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such , and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries .
turning to our development policy , I would say that the global context has changed drastically .
the marginalisation of many economies , increased poverty in the world , the need for better management of environmental interdependence , the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns .
it is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves .
fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned .
to focus on the input coming from the evaluations , I would mention the following problems : the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence .
this is due to the complexity of our own structures , but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States .
the Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments , procedures and institutional mechanisms .
often policies are more determined by the instruments available , than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities .
human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage .
on average , to manage $ US 10 million of aid there are 2.9 staff at the Commission , compared with 4.3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States .
this is a real problem : there are too many different financial instruments , each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings .
this is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system .
in order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament .
it is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way , which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework , that is , the Council and Parliament .
the lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed .
by focusing the Community &apos;s development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States .
this is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado .
when we talk policies nowadays , we engage in a process of convergence .
this is part of the solution .
we are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action .
everything has become more and more complex .
this is also true of development cooperation .
no single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes , ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender , environment , good governance and institutional reforms .
it is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country .
this should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action .
this is where we want to go .
to identify the EC &apos;s priority areas of support , account has to be taken of the Community &apos;s specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions .
I will mention just a few : our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation ; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interests ; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual Member States can normally do .
also , our presence on the ground : basically , I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves , we are seen as a neutral , welcome partner for this experiment world-wide - something which nobody else can claim to be .
it is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework .
it is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up , by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement .
we will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested .
I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate .
parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect .
this will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson .
I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF .
the problem , however , should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission ; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget . this sermon , therefore , really belongs in the Council .
Mr President , I thank Mr Nielson .
he has talked extensively about the new Lomé Convention , although this is not really the topic of this morning &apos; s meeting .
we want to talk about coherence .
this is the topic .
ever since the early nineties , the European Parliament , the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired , especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies .
this problem has been highlighted on several occasions , to whit in 1992 , in 1995 and 1997 .
the examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us .
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now .
in fact , the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997 .
in 1998 , it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements .
but what have we seen since then ?
fine words , as is the case again today , but no report . it is too crazy for words , really .
it is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy . time and time again , good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented .
it is , therefore , with good reason that we bring this up here today .
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions .
a number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production .
in the Union , sugar is produced from sugar beet .
in order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar , a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar .
the result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted .
at the same time , we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid .
a Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me : if you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union , we would not need your development aid at all .
another example is cacao .
the European Union intends to permit 5 % of alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market .
this could just as well be 0 % - the internal market would still be harmonised .
by pitching the percentage level at 5 % , which is now likely to be the case , it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage .
it seems to be heading this way nevertheless .
what are we actually doing then ?
this is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does ?
it seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles , our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries .
there are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes .
why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma , where an elected President is imprisoned , parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered ?
why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan , where a great deal of the fighting is still going on , with weapons , no less , funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are ?
the inconsistency is astonishing .
here too , Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lomé Convention .
if the new Lomé Convention is simply put into operation , without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy , the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a biblical expression .
the Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time : in agriculture , commerce , in conflict prevention , in the peace operations , in the fisheries sector , migration and environment .
Mr Nielson , what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy .
once again , all your fine examples , your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground .
this is also at the request of the citizens .
we have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992 : this is the topic of this debate .
I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , following the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen , I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate .
the topic touches the very core of the European Union .
let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating . Article 178 , Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows : &quot; the Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries &quot; .
what are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account ?
Article 177 specifies these objectives as &quot; sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries , and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them &quot; , the &quot; smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries &quot; .
Mr President , these are no arbitrary objectives . these are articles , statutory articles , which form part of the European acquis established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply .
every statutory article should , of course , not just be judged on its regularity , but also on the importance of its contents .
I am of the opinion - and luckily I am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens .
the interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government .
this is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society , and also important from the point of view of effectiveness , for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently .
we should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is .
reality is obstinate .
it is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner , without any backhandedness .
the government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas , and to show where , when and why , problems occur with coherence of policy , rather than sweeping it all under the carpet .
what we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure .
poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention .
it is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens , but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable , international environment , in which the goal of human safety is pursued .
this is a moral interest , a safety interest and is , ultimately , even in the interest of our economy .
in whose interest is it really if European taxpayers &apos; money is used to support economic development in Namibia , and if , at the same time , the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidies , financed by the same tax payers ?
we are all acting as if this is not really happening , but we all know that it is .
it is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand .
the general interest of policy coherence is , therefore , a responsibility of the Commission as a whole , of the Council , and of the European Parliament .
this responsibility cannot only be borne by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid , however much we like to see him or hear him talk , or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation .
what we need here is an integral approach .
after the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson , I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals , not only by Mr Nielson , but by the entire Commission , in order to make the policy coherent as a whole .
this is why we urge the Commission , in this sharp and clear resolution , to develop specific instruments .
we need to pinpoint , and draw up an inventory of , the problem areas for coherence .
we need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved .
this is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent .
this is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission , in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , if our neighbour &apos; s roof is leaking , we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water , but it is , of course , more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof .
the crisis in last year &apos; s Commission has been solved today , but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach , which , no doubt , the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution .
I would wish the Commissioner all the best in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council .
Mr President , let us be clear from the outset : when it comes to cooperation , coherence is far from being the watchword .
the Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but , as the previous speakers have explained so well , there are various distortions to these declarations .
the first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies .
this gives rise to serious malfunctions , because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes , whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done .
and let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop .
the second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes .
we state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State .
the third area of incoherence is human rights .
we say that we want to protect human rights .
we encourage developing countries to respect human rights .
we even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights .
we ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns .
and yet , at the same time , we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines .
nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations .
the fourth area of incoherence in the European Union &apos; s cooperation policy is this : how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping .
the European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries .
we must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them .
I will not even mention oil ; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa .
furthermore , and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence , we demand respect for biodiversity , for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature ; but at the same time , and this was apparent during recent negotiations , we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements .
these agreements risk being extended to living organisms , which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmers in the south , at the hands of the multinationals .
and yet , and this is the sixth area of incoherence , we do not defend the application of the current Treaties .
on the one hand , we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and , on the other hand , we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS , despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre .
the eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature .
we are always saying think globally , act locally .
and yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs .
and what about agriculture and the environment ? still more problems , still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted , not to mention research , emigration or health .
in short , we claim that we want to help developing countries and , at the same time , we encourage the liberalisation of trade , which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective .
I say it again , the European Union &apos; s cooperation and development policy is not coherent. and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament , the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort , at long last , to put some coherence into our policy .
Mr President , I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate , not just because development is in general an important issue , but because it is also a topical one .
Seattle was a failure , and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons .
the meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries .
the Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok , and is suffering the consequences of that failure .
in the meantime , however , as has already been mentioned , the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded .
this goes to show just how topical this subject is .
we could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April .
however , I would also like to add that any analysis , no matter how superficial , inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north-south relations , including those between the European Union and the less developed countries .
furthermore , the recent Community budget cuts in this area , for the present financial year , are part of this trend , as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message .
Michel Camdessus , a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund , said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference , and I am now quoting , that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other . he was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries .
it may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position , but he did indeed say this , and I heard it with my own ears .
this comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation , and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould .
a new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries .
this is a positive development in itself , especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue .
we will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth , but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time , even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points .
certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these .
this was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions , and this is certainly true of the European Union , especially in the field of good governance and trade .
but it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group , which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle .
I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging , especially as regards trade , and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area .
lastly , we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries .
we cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed .
Mr President , having listened to the Council and the Commission today , I just had to look at my agenda .
yes , it does say : &apos; coherence of different Union policies with development policy &apos; .
but we have not heard a single word on this subject , and I find that deeply embarrassing .
we have been waiting for a report on coherence for years .
it ought to have been here in writing today and , after having heard Mr Nielson &apos; s speech , I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission .
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence , and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today .
because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence , I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism , namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new , relevant legislation from this aspect .
I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU &apos; s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries : dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa , tomato purée in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica .
the examples are , I hope , all well known . in any case , they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products .
European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU .
this is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries , which accounts for 69 % of the total work force there compared with 1.7 % in the EU .
add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34 % of the developing countries &apos; gross national product , compared with 5.3 % in the EU .
there is neither coherence nor human decency here .
why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact ?
Mr President , how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental .
the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council .
they pointed out that the UK , France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population .
they then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto .
is the Council discussing this issue ?
is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members , rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent ?
have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what , if any , consideration has been given to it ?
as this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union , surely it should receive priority consideration .
how decisions are made is all-important .
co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly . Mr President , I thank the Council and the Commission for their statements this morning , but I will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about .
much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy , I question whether today is the time to be holding it .
however , the Council statement gave me hope for the future .
it is quite obvious to me , as someone who specialises in development policy , that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations .
I will give some examples shortly .
however , I remind this House that , back in June 1997 , a Council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the EU policies in relation to its development cooperation policy .
this was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report , the first of which was to be discussed in 1998 .
we still await the first report , and that is why I believe this debate was premature , as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning .
the areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important , such as peace-building , conflict prevention and resolution , food security , fisheries and immigration .
some of these issues have been discussed in depth .
I personally feel that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State , with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter .
the issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture , trade , environment and biodiversity , but herein lies the real problem : these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the European Union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular .
Members of this House will have differing views , even within the same political parties , depending on ( a ) which country they come from or ( b ) which committee they sit on .
there are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries .
as a lack of coherence , one can cite as Mrs Sandbæk did , the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry .
we have beef exported to southern Africa , to Namibia and South Africa , which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland , so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union .
remember too , some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years .
if we simply import raw materials from these developing countries , rather than allowing them the add-on value of producing their finished articles in their own country , we deny them the very poverty-eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations .
I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development .
there is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment .
I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document .
Mr President , this morning &apos; s debate is very important .
I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development , because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective .
however , if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy , we will end up totally frustrated and , furthermore , the result will be negative .
as with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics , it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out .
the result of this absurd game is not zero , but rather a minus number , as a consequence of the material , financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise .
with regard to policy , this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another .
in today &apos; s globalised world , this fact is all the more obvious .
there are no boundaries for Community policies .
I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies , and that , together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission , they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union .
both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state , in their respective working programmes , that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries , but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence .
both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied .
for example , the Commission , in its long term guidelines , says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity , supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account .
the Commission is addressing a very important area , that is , commercial policy .
however , this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development , agriculture , fisheries policy , immigration , our position in international financial institutions , the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform .
the Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time , it is true , being in November 1999 , and also on other occasions , such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results .
since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say , as some previous speakers have pointed out .
what we really want , however , is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination , complementarity and , the most complex one , which we are discussing at the moment , coherence , will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union .
let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference , the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services - , this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement , to perfect a more coherent political union .
we therefore hope that the Commission , in the report it is going to present to us on global policy , will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resources and the specific management of public interests .
Mr President , I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and , in common with others , express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence .
but we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is .
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of , in my view , useful figures .
at the beginning of the nineteenth century , real per capita income in the world &apos; s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries . in 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher .
and there is no sign of this trend &apos; s being reversed .
on the contrary , it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further . this is shown by the following figures : the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30 : 1 in 1960 , 60 : 1 in 1990 and 74 : 1 in 1997 .
these figures are from before the Internet revolution took off .
in other words , there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries , including the EU countries , are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale .
in a global village , major discrepancies in the world will not , in the longer term , be tolerated by the poorest section of the village .
at some time or another , there will be a revolt , and it will be fully justified .
I would therefore urge the Council &apos; s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and , above all , to conclude it in such a way that we all of us , including the people of Europe , realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide .
the EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7 % .
it may well be that others are worse , but that does not place us in any better a light .
above all , however , we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us .
as far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word &quot; trade &quot; at all .
I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States . I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up , not only in the Commission but also in the Member States .
I should also like to say that , in my view , what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from , respectively , the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development . in that way , we should perhaps have a basis for discussion , instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission , which is scarcely likely to produce results .
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution .
as Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels , we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications .
let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries .
this technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and , in this connection , the EU can set the agenda , leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities .
Mr President , &quot; The EU &apos; s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired &quot; .
this is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week , commenting on the Union &apos; s development policy .
this is not new .
ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation , its effectiveness and quality have been called into question .
hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror .
why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally ?
one of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy &apos; s internal conflict .
in terms of trade and agriculture , in particular , the European policy is in conflict with the development policy .
we seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries .
this has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation .
we should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations , but as a policy in its own right .
I advocate transparent , joint and efficient development policy .
as long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money , it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States .
finally , I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible , so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense .
as various Members have already commented , we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies , whose objectives run counter to development in those countries .
and we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies , tourism , the environment , agriculture , fisheries and industry .
we are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies .
so there is a whole raft of contradictions .
in my opinion , these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies . they are , if anything , more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States .
we have to be aware of this .
we often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world , as was recently the case with Indonesia , when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment .
for me , these are the most serious contradictions in all this , more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies .
we obviously know that , even within any one country , there are always contradictions between various policies .
that is a fact of life .
and we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies , in this case development policy .
we have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them . the underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one .
I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy , and that this monitoring centre &apos; s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies , but should also cover Member States &apos; actions and policies , including the actions of economic groups , which I think are also important .
this monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction .
I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House .
our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective , not merely within the European Union , but also at world level , given the increasing globalisation of the economy .
if we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiations , because it would be contradictory if the European Union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself , only for the United States and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint .
that is why I consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next WTO round .
Mr President , the Director-General of the DG for Development has said that to produce a report on coherence of EU policies with development policies , before this spring &apos; s paper on development policy itself , is like putting the cart before the horse .
never mind that the Commission &apos; s requirement to produce an annual report , set out clearly in the Council resolution , has produced only one &quot; non-paper &quot; , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is climbing uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards .
time after time development policy is forgotten or is an afterthought when the major policies of this European Union are considered .
take the new chocolate directive , which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid .
there has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries , 90 % of which are our ACP partners , estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15 % .
take the fishing agreements , where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters .
we are , at the same time , negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe &apos; s large-scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small-scale fish workers in those countries world-wide .
take the trade agreements .
as Mr Nielson said this morning with regard to Lomé , preferential access is only for &quot; essentially all the products of the least-developed countries &quot; .
in other words , when EU commercial interests are concerned , poverty considerations go out of the window .
in the stance that we took at Seattle , why such a silence on the EU &apos; s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the GATT , including for the crucial textile sector ?
on the common agricultural policy , the biggest culprit - no development impact assessment of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms .
everyone now knows of the scandal of the export refund scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on West African markets , slashing prices for local cattle farmers by half .
today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes .
who will be next , quite literally , for the chop ?
I welcome Mr Amadeus &apos; statement this morning , which acknowledged the difficulties of non-budgetisation of the EDF , which called for a more active role for the Development Council and which called for development priorities to be central to the EU &apos; s emerging common foreign and security policy .
I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992 , its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union .
action simply has not been taken .
that is why we want annual reports , we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure , to make sure action is actually taken .
I ask Mr Nielson , in his summing-up , to directly address those points in the resolution .
Mr President , I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture .
over the past couple of years , a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and , more especially , the Lomé countries .
the results are certainly not what we expected .
what could be the cause of this ?
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries , barring a few exceptions .
I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop .
no farmer , anywhere in the world , will produce something if prices are too low .
the governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma : whom should they support , the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food ?
this fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission , and not by the Commission on its own . in most countries where the Commission is active , development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves .
it should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission .
it is up to the Commission &apos; s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach .
special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production .
far too often , artificial fertiliser , veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge .
once the project comes to an end after five years , the policy of free gifts also ends .
I think , therefore , that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects , and as far as I know , this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination .
finally , I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use .
every year , I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund , that they are far behind in spending the funds .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted , which is a pity .
we should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi , for example , who has missed a great chance right from the outset , for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners - and this is better than four , I have to admit - but this does not really make for a coherent policy .
we also note that , as before , there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments .
the President-in-Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion , namely to budget the European Development Fund .
Parliament would , of course , welcome this with open arms . if this were possible , it would be a huge , historic victory .
since Amsterdam , three terms have taken centre stage : complementarity , coordination and cohesion .
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields .
if a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion , if a request is made at all , then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult , unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all .
I would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion , and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion , for it is a long way off yet .
one thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council .
he stated : &quot; contradictions in policy can lead to balance . &quot;
it is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand , and vice versa .
but this leads to status-quo and self-deceit , and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes , indeed , but changes which have only made poverty worse .
this is supposed to be our priority , would you believe .
I know that we do a great deal of good , but let us start with this very essential aspect .
Mr President , we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission , but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion .
the first is concerned with conflict resolution .
for many years , I have tried , through the Council and the Commission , to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in , and working for , conflict resolution in the Western Sahara , which is occupied by Morocco .
the UN has a peace plan .
we ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end .
I also want to take up the subject of migration .
I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries , which might make it easier to expel immigrants , asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds .
I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms .
we now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds .
three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age .
this is not because of a lack of food , but because of what we have talked a lot about today , namely increasing poverty .
food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests .
I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply , specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason .
I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce .
women appear to be completely absent from all areas , especially development policy when , of course , we are not in reality absent at all .
Mr President , the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid .
the level of aid is naturally important , and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased .
this ought to be done with , in particular , a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity .
however , the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries .
a number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed .
the latter include trade , agricultural and fisheries policies .
other important areas are , of course , the flow of private investments , cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with , and finances solutions to , a variety of global problems which affect us all .
these problems include questions of climate , health issues , biodiversity etc , and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation , that is to say the new economy which is developing .
in this economy , the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked .
in my opinion , what we are discussing here today is partly the EU &apos; s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance .
the report , or survey , which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded , showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be , is naturally quite crucial .
I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more .
the Commission is new and has to be given time , but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission .
I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission .
in addition to a report of this kind , I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character .
an analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries . these include technology , trade , cooperation in the field of research etc .
finally , Parliament recommends , in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution , that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence .
I believe it is only a coincidence , but the Commissioner for the Environment is also , of course , to participate in this group .
let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed .
policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other .
there are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest .
Mr President , the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less- and least-developed countries , it is purely a rich country selfish interest .
yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent .
there the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs , allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain .
it did not work ; poverty became worse than ever .
the medicine may not taste too good in the short term , but opening one &apos; s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term .
is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular ?
as Mr Nielson said , this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity .
yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough .
we also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries . Parliament &apos; s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU .
it is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words .
Mr President , in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence , coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States .
there is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union &apos; s ability to match words with action .
I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes , to post-conflict reconstruction , and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world , particularly in developing countries .
over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance , assistance to victims and related activities .
the Member States have spent similar amounts .
but there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span .
Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States .
this has been talked about for years .
the Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes , strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions , ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell .
it would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes .
a proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines .
it seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational , procedural , financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union .
are these afflictions of the past , or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations ?
Mr President , Commissioner Nielson , the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence .
and it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights , democracy , rule of law , and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously , and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent , rather , we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect .
for these are prerequisite to any development .
if these criteria are not adhered to , then development does not stand a chance
the same goes for Cuba , Mr Modrow .
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process . but for this to happen , there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba .
after all , we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International .
it may well be that you , having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships , view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber , and that you have problems where good governance is concerned .
nonetheless , these are important criteria for the European Union .
there is a second issue I would like to raise .
we are discussing coherence here .
many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent .
in my view , however , the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too .
there is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another .
nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union &apos; s budget but the EDF remains outside it .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control , and to bodies such as OLAF , then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability .
this , to my mind , is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do , i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union .
Mr President , we certainly must concede that , on balance , this text is full of good intentions , but we did not vote in favour of it in committee , nor shall we do so in plenary . we had two reasons for this , both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly .
first , the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF ; clearly that is misguided .
in our view , cooperation is , and should remain , an intergovernmental exercise .
with Europe preparing to enlarge , communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget , quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy .
lastly , the Commission has , in the recent past , had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently , as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely .
why should we add to them ?
secondly , we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie &apos; s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because , in the final analysis , this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse .
it is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank .
and let me say in passing , it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to .
as a result , we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed .
the part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry , port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law . imagine the potential cost of such a precedent .
it is proof , as if we still needed it , of the fact that immature diplomacy , which defends no interests , unless of course they are individual interests , and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs , is not just inefficient , it is positively dangerous .
finally , a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report .
nowadays , let us face it , the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington .
it was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened .
the Corrie report missed this chance and we must , regrettably , punish it for losing so much .
. ( PT ) Mr President , by way of both a conclusion and a summary , I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate .
first of all , many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality , and increases poverty .
this suggests that something must be done , failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen .
secondly , it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context , taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality .
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union &apos; s role in international development policies is significant .
finally , I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency &apos; s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union &apos; s policies , and in particular in the context of its foreign policy .
we believe that this is absolutely vital , failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies , and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe &apos; s status in the international system .
for this reason it may be necessary , as I have stressed , to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies .
in this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention , which succeeds the Lomé Convention , is an important instrument of renewal , and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process , as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle .
. I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate .
I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion .
we will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence .
this discussion is not new .
we are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it , as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence .
I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda .
this also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include , as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament , the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission .
I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything .
I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist , and we certainly do have them .
much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State , as has been very honestly said here in this House : people more or less identify with their spheres of interest , and all this is legitimate .
I would , however , warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system .
this exists , but it is only a small part of what we are discussing .
the major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on , and this is the problem .
Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low .
this is true in our part of the world , but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective .
they farm , not just for a living , but in order to live , and this makes a difference .
subsistence farming is not based on price calculations , it is based on the hope of rain in the next season .
this does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver better than so far .
from that perspective , what I am saying here is of deep relevance .
other issues have been mentioned : cattle-farming in Namibia , tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean .
we should not be too masochistic .
there is a limit to how useful that is .
all these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of .
the intervention prices have been regulated , and the problems we had with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support .
these are real problems , but they have all been dealt with .
as regards the issue of cacao , chocolate : I repeat that the 5 % has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries .
what we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in Burkina Faso as coconuts for farmers in Ghana .
this is not a clear case of incoherence , it is more a case of a competition between suppliers .
what was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated .
in the Overseas Countries and Territories Framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem , but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some European companies than with generating income in the Caribbean . in any case , this is a matter which we are currently dealing with .
I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa .
in all modesty , I would claim that this is something that documents that the Commission is willing to walk or fly the extra mile in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests .
we certainly have done our share to solve that problem , and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement .
finally , I thank you again for this debate .
we will come back again with material on these issues , because these problems , in one way or another , are here to stay , simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally-defined trade interests , etc . we have to reconcile those different approaches .
thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m .
next session of UN Human Rights Commission
the next item is the statement by the Council on EU priorities for the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission on 20 March 2000 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the European Union played an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held in Geneva in March and April 1999 .
it tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran , Iraq , in the Israeli settlements , in Burma / Myanmar , in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan , and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on Colombia and on East Timor .
for the first time , the European Union tabled a resolution on the death penalty , which was enormously successful , and led work on a resolution concerning children &apos; s rights , which was a joint initiative with the Latin American group of countries .
the Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be held in Geneva in March and April .
the European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March .
in particular , there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty .
to date , the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect , and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary , including Article 2 ( 7 ) of the Charter of the United Nations , which refers to sovereignty .
as you know , at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year , the United States decided , at a very late stage , to table a draft resolution on China .
this draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion .
the European Union voted against that motion .
the European Union &apos; s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999 : there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China , but an EU vote against the no-action motion .
it is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote .
the United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution .
this initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China &apos; s part : the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union , in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States &apos; initiative .
this initiative is being discussed within the Union , but with no hope of a decision in the near future .
it is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible , and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000 .
in view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission , we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close .
it is therefore important this year , too , that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution .
in this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva .
the European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues , and whether or not it agrees with this initiative , this is in any case legitimate from this point of view .
the next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon , and will include seminars on legal issues and on women &apos; s rights , and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part .
the European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures , and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February .
the presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern .
discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly ; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue , while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage .
on various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue , and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas .
it was decided that the dialogue should continue , but in a more targeted and effective way , given that China has agreed with the European Union &apos; s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars .
lastly , during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself .
a working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission &apos; s mechanisms . this working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous , especially in the financial field .
the European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission &apos; s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level .
. Mr President , I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism , civil and political rights and the right to development .
as the presidency said , much remains to be done , despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session .
that is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues .
for example , discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament &apos; s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases .
it is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult .
that does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference .
however , let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues : the death penalty , Cuba and China .
I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks .
we are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission .
this has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly , I have always voted against the death penalty .
Spurred on by Amnesty International and others , one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty .
we know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly .
we had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid .
the New York stage is different from Geneva .
last year &apos; s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues .
it certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty .
the debate in Geneva , however , is more focused on human rights issues .
we may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there .
secondly , Cuba .
I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously .
we are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom , moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty .
we are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions .
we are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of NGOs and the work of our human rights working group based in the EU embassies in Havana .
we have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities , and this Parliament has done the same .
but I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba .
we want a fair and open society in Cuba , a Cuba which respects the principles of the market , the sanctity of contract and the rule of law .
we want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
my views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal , namely China .
quite simply , I want us to be engaged with China .
it would be self-indulgent and self-defeating , as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity , to want anything else .
I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers .
so what should we do ?
naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms .
it is a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which does not include China - or Russia , for that matter .
but I do not believe today , nor have I ever believed , that our burgeoning economic relationship with China - manifested , for example , by China &apos; s EUR 25 billion surplus with the European Union - should silence us when it comes to China &apos; s human rights record .
for me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in China - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so - but rather what is the most effective way of doing this ?
so what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year ?
as the presidency has noted , the Union as a whole is considering its position .
but I strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the Member States ought to take proper account .
first , while some people question whether tabling a Geneva resolution makes any difference , several of the most distinguished Chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move , not least because of the message it sends to people in China itself .
that is a point that deserves serious consideration .
secondly , we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in China in recent months , for instance , the heavy sentences imposed on democracy campaigners , the detention and recent punishments meted out to members of Christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of Falun Gong .
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet .
we have made our views very clear to them .
while we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties , there is a dark side to the picture as well .
Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China .
that is true and potentially valuable , although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked .
of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres .
that is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level .
naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long-term process , but I wish I could point to more real gains .
the next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test .
it will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not .
what , finally , do we want to see as the first steps ?
well , for example , we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them .
I wish we were closer to that .
where does all that leave us this year ?
I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds .
what I hope is , first , that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it , that we will not allow some to be picked off , that our position will not be based on self-delusion or pretence , that it will be a common position and a sensible position .
I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions .
but if that is true , then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward .
if we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue , then we need to be able to convince you , the NGO community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere .
that , in my judgement , is the challenge for the next few weeks .
I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world , and particularly in China .
thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
we will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote .
welcome
I am delighted to welcome a delegation of the Hong Kong Legislative Council to Parliament .

. as Mrs Wallström explained during yesterday &apos;s debate , the Commission is able to accept the following amendments : amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 13 .
the Commission can also accept Amendment No 4 in principle .
the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 , 5 , 6 , 12 , 14 , 18 and 16 .

report ( A5-0023 / 2000 ) by Mr Böge , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91 / 68 / EEC as regards scrapie ( COM ( 1998 ) 623 - C4-0026 / 1999 - 1998 / 0324 ( COD ) )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
report ( A5-0015 / 2000 ) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70 / 524 / EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs ( COM ( 1999 ) 388 - C5-0134 / 1999 - 1999 / 0168 ( CNS ) )
before the final vote :
. ( de ) Mr President , following this vote , I would like to ask the competent Commissioner , Mr Byrne , if , now that he has seen how much support there is in this Chamber , he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments ?
. I regret to say that I believe that the thought-out position I advanced yesterday is the correct position .
the comprehensive approach that the Commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under Article 152 where Parliament will have a codecision function .
that is the appropriate way of dealing with this .
Mr President , in accordance with Article 69 ( 2 ) , I call for referral back to committee .
the reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure , as proposed by the Commission .
we have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive , in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the Commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms .
we take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time , but the Commission will not adopt this .
I believe that , in accordance with Article 69 ( 2 ) , we must endeavour to enter into discussion with the Commission , and I would therefore urge my fellow MEPs to decide in favour of referral back to committee .
( Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee )
before the vote :
Mr President , permit me to say quite publicly to Mrs Stenzel , who is a member of the ÖVP executive , that many MEPs are horrified that you have entered into a coalition with Haider , and that we wish to denounce you for doing so !
( applause from the left . Heckling from the right )
. ( de ) Mr Cohn-Bendit , I do not think that the European Parliament has any business intervening to such a huge extent in a country &apos; s domestic politics , in the way that you are doing .
I can speak for my party , which championed Austria &apos; s membership of the European Union in the early days .
as a political force , we serve to guarantee that Austria will continue to embrace European values .
I refuse to allow myself to be ostracised for internal and party political reasons !
this does not reflect the truth of the situation but is pure propaganda .
I utterly reject this !
( loud , sustained applause from the centre and from the right , protests from the left )
welcome
this is perhaps an appropriate moment to welcome to the official gallery , a delegation of four members of the Moroccan parliament , led by Mr Brahim Rachidi , Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives .
we are honoured by the visit of this delegation which is taking place shortly before the entry into force on 1 March 2000 of the Association Agreement between Morocco and the European Union .
on this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments .
it is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries will be visiting Morocco on 20 to 22 March .
I hope the delegation has an excellent visit to Strasbourg .
( loud applause )
Mr President , I just want to take advantage of your welcome to the delegation by pointing out that the House also has the pleasure of welcoming the heads of the Austrian anti-racist associations who are honouring us with a visit .
( the sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. for a formal sitting on the occasion of an address by Mr Vaclav Havel , President of the Czech Republic and resumed at 12.50 p.m. )

explanations OF VOTE- Lienemann report ( A5-0014 / 2000 )
. ( FR ) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE .
I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries , whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean , countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries .
the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have , for the most part , been retained in the common position adopted by the Council .
as far as the third phase of LIFE ( 2000-2004 ) is concerned , the instrument is to be divided into three sections , LIFE-Nature ( 47 % of the resources ) , LIFE-Environment ( 47 % ) and LIFE-Third Countries ( 6 % ) .
in my opinion , the most important amendments concern the following :
LIFE &apos; s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment , particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies , as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment ;
improving the efficiency , transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE , procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public , and procedures for cooperation between recipients ;
the objectives of LIFE : this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development , in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative , on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere ;
the contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities , and thus job creation .
I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe .
the other candidate countries ( e.g. Cyprus , Turkey , Malta ) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries .
the stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies , of course , in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme ( 2000-2004 ) .
the Commission proposal , ratified by the Council , is for EUR 613 million , whilst the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million .
I support Mrs Lienemann &apos; s firm stance .
the financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created , even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement .
if the report is adopted in plenary session , then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened , in accordance with the codecision procedure , in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme .
this type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions !
Böge report ( A5-0023 / 2000 )
. ( FR ) As an MEP and , more importantly , as a consumer , I welcome the European Commission &apos; s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union .
what is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie .
what is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis .
I also consider it essential , for the sake of coherence , that existing legislation on scrapie , which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals , should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union , rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs .
these rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie .
a number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic .
even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective , especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie , it is still a notable improvement .
it is a pledge to European citizens , who have voiced their concern , as regards European food policy , on many occasions .
the European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard .
as a result of the debates on the principle of precaution , traceability , responsibility and transparency , the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety .
this White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence .
it is up to us , as responsible Europeans , to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive .
Cederschiöld report ( A5-0008 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament .
. ( DA ) We oppose , on principle , the European Community &apos; s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States .
we are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community . at the same time , we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of distributors and practising artists .
we are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation .
- ( DE ) The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because , in the plenary debate of the previous day , Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties .
in institutional terms , there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties .
in addition , there is a clear tendency , in matters of international jurisdiction , more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction .
when it is , then , still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making processes , the question of legitimacy arises .
moreover , the concept of &apos; author &apos; is not defined in the Treaties .
in this regard , too , the Commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on , and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others .
one of the trickiest aspects is the public interest : will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture ?
and , finally , the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified . regarding this , too , there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission .
if nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation , then we must at least abstain from voting .
Graefe zu Baringdorf ( A5-0015 / 2000 )
. ( PT ) Food safety issues are in the spotlight following the BSE and dioxin scandals .
GMOs are still the subject of great uncertainty , both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health .
the precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty .
the use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just &quot; packaged &quot; for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector .
the profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises .
this is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in , making a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs , and noting that the latter &quot; shall be authorised only if ... safe for human health and the environment &quot; .
furthermore , he considers that &quot; genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document , official or otherwise , which is affixed to or accompanies the additive &quot; .
this will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer &apos; s freedom of choice .
in view of the Montreal Protocol on Genetically Modified Organisms ( GMOs ) , I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report , and I have therefore voted in favour of it .
Stenzel report ( A5-0034 / 2000 )
Mr President , I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote , on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report .
we have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the Socialist Group .
the Socialist Group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been .
this is why we are abstaining .
we want to ensure that the EQUAL report , which is very important for refugees , the elderly , the handicapped and women , simply goes ahead .
it is regrettable that , due to the procedure , the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session .
I am convinced that the rapporteur &apos; s nationality has played a certain role , which should not be of relevance in this Parliament .
this is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament .
these were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report .
we want EQUAL to go ahead .
we assent to the main thrust of it , but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage .
Mr President , as the representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party in the European Parliament , I abstained in the vote on the EQUAL initiative because , although it provides more support than in the past for projects aimed at combating age discrimination , its proposals are not sufficiently trenchant or specific .
I also abstained for another reason . I think the time has come for the European institutions to stop experimenting and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give European citizens some firm indication regarding what Europe wants Europe to be .
the time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice .
. ( DA ) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for EU initiative programmes ( CIP ) .
basically , we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but , since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used , we have simply adopted a position on the issue .
we think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report .
. ( FR ) We did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market .
nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague , all too pie in the sky .
and yet , in the chapter on aid and training for refugees , the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to &quot; refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention &quot; .
this restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout Europe are in a drastic situation , with no protection , forced to work on the black market , and to hide , while so-called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down .
the first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs , the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment , the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion .
.
I voted in favour of Mrs Stenzel &apos; s report on the EQUAL initiative as I believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous NOW , HORIZON , YOUTHSTART and INTEGRA strands of the ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT initiatives .
the lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on .
equal stands for &quot; equality &quot; .
it must be seen to deliver .
I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market .
I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment .
there must be flexibility .
I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative .
in the last programming period 9 % of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives .
the figure is now 5.35 % .
this means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated .
the Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward , concerning for example , the emphasis on access to start-up capital , how to exploit new business opportunities in cities , towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business .
this often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities .
the positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process .
I also stressed the need for prevention .
the involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted .
there must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority .
there must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets .
while there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way , overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported .
( PT ) The Commission intends to use the Community initiative EQUAL to replace the Community EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT initiatives and various subprogrammes in these areas , such as NOW , on new opportunities for women , HORIZON , for disabled persons , YOUTHSTART , for promoting the labour market integration of young people , and INTEGRA , for groups threatened with exclusion . unfortunately , this involves a significant reduction in appropriations .
accordingly , the Commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market , based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines .
this is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations .
however , in order to give this new approach some chance of success , the Commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal , a more simple and direct one , involving the NGOs from the outset , so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way .
the Commission did not do that .
we hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned .
Mr President , some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film , &quot; Cocoon &quot; , in which some elderly people drank a special kind of water that made them young again .
in my view , it is , therefore , immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and , consequently , to study and approve the provisions referred to here .
for that reason , I approved these measures , but I should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water purity at the point where it enters our houses , to ensure that it is of the highest level .
in the measures that have been adopted , I note that support for people who purify their water in their own homes has been omitted . I trust that this will be remedied in the future .
apart from Amendment No 76 , which was an error , since I intended to vote in favour , the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following fictional situation :
supposed draft environmental directive : &quot; European Parliament and Council Directive establishing the obligation to maintain , during winter , a temperature of no less than eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets , squares and parks of the cities of Europe &quot; .
guidelines of the Directive : a ) each city shall provide the means , in terms of energy and technology , sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012 ; b ) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices .
opinion of an MEP from the north of Europe : &quot; this Directive would be unfair since , for example , the cost for an inhabitant of Stockholm would be two hundred times greater than the cost for an inhabitant of Naples &quot; .
opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe : &quot; nevertheless , this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions &quot; .
( end of fiction ) .
in explaining my vote , I must say that it is positive that there is a Community directive on water , but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe , but will lead to legislative caricature .
we cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts , such as the Mediterranean countries , and countries with northern levels of rainfall .
furthermore , it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water , between different river basins , practically impossible in the future .
once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union .
( FR ) Drinking , eating , washing , farming - water irrigates each act of our daily life and we treat it , wrongly , as an unfailing and inexhaustible resource .
a simple gesture such as turning on a tap seems to bring water straight from the source .
but the source is threatening to run dry .
scientific studies are now no more than a formality : water will be the main resource at stake in years to come , starting tomorrow .
but tomorrow will be too late .
we have to lay down the rules of play today , before we all lose .
in adopting the water directive on Wednesday 15 February , the European Parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water , coastal wasters , inland waters and groundwater .
Europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water , promote its sustainable use , protect eco-systems , help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances .
we have thrown water a life-belt .
. ( FR ) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy .
the ecological disaster on the banks of the Danube is a reminder , as if we needed one , that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water .
the objective of this proposal for a directive , which dates back to 1997 , is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water , coastal waters , inland waters and groundwater .
it provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration , protect ecosystems , promote sustainable water use , help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances .
specific directives will then be adopted within this framework .
the procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy .
the proposal for a directive was amended twice , first in 1997 and then in 1998 .
a technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions .
however , the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments , most of which I support .
as far as the timetable and objectives are concerned , the Council &apos; s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive , while the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years .
the committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020 , the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020 .
the Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years , but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years .
all the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years , not 16 .
I must say that I support these reduced deadlines , especially as provision is made for derogations .
as far as costs are concerned , I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources .
I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012 .
I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , which needs no further comment : &quot; water is not a commercial product like any other but , rather , a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected , defended and treated as such &quot; .
. I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote .
we have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water .
there is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur .
however , the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which , under the rules of subsidiarity , should be left to the Member States for decision .
in my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue .
in Ireland all the major users of water , commercial , industrial and agricultural , already pay for their use of water .
this is a decision of national and local government , and this is where all future decisions should be retained .
these are the main reasons for my vote .
. the European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters .
I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy .
however , I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used .
water , in this context , is a commercial commodity .
it is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life .
we see it as positive that an attempt is being made to reverse the trend towards water degradation , which is most alarming and which governments all too often tend to sweep under the carpet .
we all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved .
but it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated , and that action on this aspect will affect all the others .
the &quot; physico-chemical and ecological quality of water &quot; was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals , and the adverse effects of other aspects was , at best , touched upon marginally .
it is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different Member States , such as specific climatic conditions , water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year , the social , economic and ecological effects of applying standards , and also of the failure to do so .
it was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects , which are very important for a country like Portugal , which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio-economic development .
but we also believe that , in many cases , the proposals put forward by the Commission and the Council represent too much of a step backwards , which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us .
. ( FR ) We are disappointed by the Council &apos; s common position on this proposal for a framework directive .
it is minimalist on a number of points , especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of , and conditions for , implementing the derogations .
however , the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the European Union wishes to pursue with this text .
the objective is of course to create , first and foremost , a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified .
however the Union should be seeking , beyond that , to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater .
public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake , as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species .
from this point of view , the common position is weak .
I should like to see our Parliament defend a more ambitious position than the Council &apos; s position , but I should also like that position to be equally credible .
the &quot; zero input &quot; and &quot; zero pollution &quot; requirement , including for substances naturally present in water , is not realistic .
I am not one of those MEPs who thinks that it is essential to adopt &quot; extremist &quot; amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the Council of Ministers .
on the contrary , I object to this systematically applied strategy .
it damages Parliament .
our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility .
overly strict , unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are unattainable .
is that the message we want to send out ?
there is one other specific point which is dear to me : Member States should be able , if they so wish , to set up trans-national water transfers .
this type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity , which we have always defended , and , as such , should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy ( through the Structural Funds ) .
I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report .
.
( ES ) We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war .
we all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective , above all , given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment .
it is clear that this model &apos; s logic of private profit has been harmful , and therefore the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences .
however , apart from these principles , there is the consideration that water , as a common resource , cannot be subjected to the rules of the market .
Surprisingly , I imagine with the best of intentions , this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers , and especially the agricultural sector , responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality .
in fact , water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market .
this means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water .
by failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant , and is therefore not a problem , from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity , stifling the chances of any economic and social development , we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon .
in the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity , which is scarce in some areas , while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use , to those who live in drought areas .
as a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity , my vote has been consistent with what I have said , as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural regions - although one with prospects - namely , the Region of Murcia .
. on behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party , I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report , we have certain reservations .
the timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable , but the timetable set by the Council of 2034 is too far in the distance .
we believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date .
we have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater .
we believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard .
the foregoing is the reason for our vote .
( FR ) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed .
the framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area .
it has clear , ambitious objectives .
we share them .
it sets environmental parameters close to zero .
but we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet .
we need a timetable , by all means , but a more gradual timetable .
the legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation , i.e. to stop discharges within 20 years , would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances .
such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross-border areas and in candidate countries , thereby complicating enlargement .
I should like , naturally , to refer to a specific sector to which I am very closely attached , i.e. agriculture , the main water-consuming sector . Agriculture must accept its share of &apos; polluter pays &apos; charges , and has in fact already started to do so , but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints , especially in arid regions .
as regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances , I am of course in favour of controls , but the question arises of the legal basis , which comes under the Euratom Treaty .
Andersson report ( A5-0033 / 2000 )
the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report . this does , of course , contain a number of good observations .
for example , it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that &quot; the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States &apos; social security systems &quot; .
now , the concept of &quot; uniform harmonisation &quot; is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question . it is also true , as it states in the explanatory statement , that harmonisation could be damaging as &quot; it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security .
no-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation &quot; .
the situation , however , is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation , and uniform harmonisation into the bargain .
paragraph D points out that &quot; the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria &quot; , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils .
finally , paragraph 7 emphasises that &quot; the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination &quot; . and , in this regard , we approach the heart of the matter .
this project , with its social harmonisation , does not constitute social policy . instead , it is an extension to the EU &apos; s EMU project , which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship , namely Great Britain , Sweden and Denmark .
it is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project .
) Mr President , I voted for the Council &apos;s strategy for modernising social protection because , in my view , it constitutes a step towards the establishment of European social and pensions legislation , although it does not actually go the whole way .
I was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote , since I believe that , in essence , the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly , despite the fact that , as we all know , the governments of the 15 Member States would like to reduce pensions to the minimum .
I hope that Parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions .
the elderly are waiting for the European Parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now .
the countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the European Union that guarantee better social protection .
. ( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our Swedish Social Democratic colleague , Jan Andersson , on the Commission &apos; s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security .
the starting point for the Commission &apos; s communication is the implementation of EMU which , with its demand for stability and growth , creates the basis for the Member States &apos; being able to maintain their social security arrangements .
the report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but , rather , better use of available resources .
we also notice that , according to the explanatory statement , modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements , either , and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back .
no-one would benefit from this situation .
both in the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mr Andersson , it is emphasised that it is the Member States which have responsibility for and , therefore , also determine the content of , social security arrangements .
cooperation on these matters within the framework of the EU should create added value , based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing , the aim being to define best practice .
. ( SV ) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals , which we support , but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report .
in particular , we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the Commission &apos; s becoming involved in telling the Member States what to do ( see , for example , paragraph 7 ) .
we wish to emphasise that the sphere of social and social security policy should chiefly be the domain of the Member States , even if the enlargement of the EU requires a greater degree of coordination than there has been in the past .
. ( FR ) The current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment , poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending .
the policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation .
of course we need to modernise these systems .
in France , in particular , we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions .
we also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices , chaos and waste .
more importantly , we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic , monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and reconquer the internal market so that we can create jobs .
the Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy ; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision-making powers as regards funding , i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe , which is why we voted against this text .
social protection should be an expression , first and foremost , of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost , exclusively in fact , under the jurisdiction of the nation state .
social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences .
otherwise it is merely the financial processing , at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens , of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration .
.
( SV ) We have abstained from voting for Jan Andersson &apos; s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security .
we are basically well disposed towards the European Union .
as Swedish Liberals , we see European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment , trade , movement across borders , human rights and conflict management .
in these areas , Europe &apos; s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity .
we also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect .
that is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see .
it must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with , which is to say cross-border issues .
all other questions ought to be dealt with at local , regional or national levels .
social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers , except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union .
each Member State ought to have full responsibility for , and the right autonomously to decide upon , its social security systems .
health care , child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational .
the same applies to labour market policy .
we do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security .
for us , it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use .
that does not , however , prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere .
equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda .
we wholeheartedly support , at national level , many of the ideas presented in Mr Andersson &apos; s report .
. ( it ) The report gives a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernising social protection in Europe will be accompanied by an analogous process of cohesion .
we therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions .
numerous policies have already gone in this direction , albeit laboriously , and many more still need to do so before Europe , in terms of subsidiarity , is seen as one house , not only by its own people , but also by those in the candidate countries .
moreover , the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation .
consequently , if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future , in light of the economic and employment changes taking place , as well as the requirements of society , modernisation is absolutely essential .
there are three main aspects that need to be highlighted .
the first is that economic policy , employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional .
the second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them .
nowadays , it is becoming more commonplace , as well as efficient , to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes .
but , in our view , that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced , either as regards the universality or , we hope , the quality of the basic social protection provided .
it is , to a large extent , a principle of justice that imbues both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance , where , in particular , strategic coordination by the public authority is essential , even though it has been modernised .
the third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the European Union .
today , a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking , and the current systems are , in the main , run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual Member States .
therefore , any modernisation process has to take account of economic , employment and social protection differences between the various countries , whether Member States or candidate countries .
what is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process , which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences , should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse .
it is , after all , a matter of civilisation , progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community .
. ( SV ) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy , human freedoms and rights , and a social market economy .
these values must be given expression in the form of solidarity with the weaker groups in our society and in the world around us .
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , it is the Member States themselves which devise their own social security systems .
inhabitants of countries in the European Union ought , nonetheless , to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection , irrespective of which country they live in .
the report seeks &quot; effective and ambitious fiscal coordination &quot; , without going on to define more specifically what this means .
as we see it , such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot , therefore , be supported .
we are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report .
the report emphasises the social dimension of European cooperation , which is something to be welcomed .
it is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play , and not to play , with regard to social security .
clarification of this kind is missing from the report , which is unfortunate .
. ( EL ) On reading the Commission &apos; s statement on social protection , which is animated by so many good intentions , one wonders whether its authors and the working people in Europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality .
one also wonders whether this &apos; coordinated modernisation strategy &apos; is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people .
we agree with many of the rapporteur &apos; s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission &apos; s and the Council &apos; s intentions and plans concerning social protection .
its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security , and for flexibilising social protection itself .
clearly , what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control , towards systems based on private insurance agencies , which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people , who besides the higher cost , will &apos; enjoy &apos; even more degraded social provisions .
the fostering of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the Member States is not only unjustifiable , but , on the contrary , makes manifest the political expediencies and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them , to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit .
it is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems .
so how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed , impoverished and marginalised people , the &apos; working poor &apos; of part-time employment , and working conditions that are dissociated from the policies implemented ?
social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe , and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business , and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people .
today , in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment , it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people , but this demands a different system of economic and social development , which the EU cannot possibly create , because of its nature and character .
on the basis of these views , we wish to express our categorical opposition to the &apos; modernisation &apos; of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting , and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion .
that concludes the explanations of vote .

next session of UN Human Rights Commission ( continuation )
the next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights ( 20 March 2000 ) , including the situation in China .
Mr President , I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council . this is a Council declaration , and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate .
I think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need , which has been expressed by all the political Groups , for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva , so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue , one which is so dear to this House .
following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission , I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see .
at a European Union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory , since , for example , although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common instrument in all Member States , not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them .
another clear drawback in this area is the fact that the European Union itself is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails .
I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights .
in my opinion , this resolution contains a series of essential points , but I would like to stress one in particular , that is , the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations .
Mr President , in a world such as this , which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation , and not only in the economic field , our responses , in order to be effective , must be concerted and coordinated .
in order to make our actions effective , we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present .
this Parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , this Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible .
soon , in May , the European Commission intends to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratisation in the Union &apos; s external relations .
I believe that this should be applied to all areas , in particular also the budgetary area .
lastly , I must recognise the important contributions made by civil society in this area , as well as the often underestimated role of the numerous non-governmental organisations who act on the ground .
the Union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work .
Mr President , Commissioners , when this House is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance , if you will , that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue .
the absence of the Council , as well as of the majority of MEPs , shows just how great the divide is between our noble , elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights .
I believe that , as a beginning , Parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the Geneva session to narrow that divide . it should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support .
we must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished .
the role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on , particularly at the level of prevention .
in that sense , we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law .
it seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed .
nowadays , there are many , perhaps too many , treaties on human rights . if those treaties remain mere expressions , they are no more than useless depositories of people &apos;s thoughts .
the time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase , namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis , although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed .
I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court .
in my view , we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally .
we have often employed instruments which , at the formal level , make us feel comfortable , but which , in terms of practical results , are totally ineffectual .
by that I mean the use , and often abuse , of embargoes during recent years , and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries , where there have been human rights violations .
in particular , we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded .
globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process .
we should therefore do what is necessary to update the areas in which we can intervene , with renewed strength , to safeguard human rights .
in that context I would mention the following : social rights , workers &apos; rights , quality of work , the need to ensure respect , where necessary , for all the criteria laid down by the International Labour Organisation , the right to tolerance and to respect - a right to which all minorities are entitled , particularly within the European Union .
I would also mention the right to develop . it is the right of all peoples who , in turn , are the sum of countless individuals each one of whom has the right to develop and to a future that , most importantly , is full of hope and personal growth , within each individual society .
all those aspects should be part of a rationale , a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human rights .
that is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments , even if it goes against their interests .
Mr President , one of the saving features of this Parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy : the flag flies high , as Mrs Malmström put it .
at the same time , however , we shut our eyes to the Union &apos; s own problems : to the violence , inequality , and fourth world reality , which is part of everyday life in the EU .
it is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in Geneva .
the rhetoric that we use , however , often smacks of smugness , verging on the sort of narcissism we associate with human rights attitudes in North America .
it is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non-EU countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum-seekers , whose position is now becoming more difficult in the EU .
let us , in particular , focus attention on the re-admission clauses , which present a threat to the Geneva Convention and which should be blocked .
unless we can maintain high standards of human rights with respect to refugees and asylum-seekers , we are not worthy of those European values which make up the European identity , as Vaclav Havel said here today , and among which he particularly mentioned respect for human rights and solidarity .
I worked for many years on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open , European-style , pluralistic democratic society .
I fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction , towards European exclusiveness and apartheid .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , in my view , the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty .
we have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in Geneva .
we failed at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext , I refer to article 2.7 , which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts .
the question of the death penalty should therefore be raised at this year &apos; s General Assembly , certainly not at the Geneva session .
as Mr Patten said , and I would like to thank him for the positions which he defended , the crucial point is China .
unfortunately , the positions taken by the Commission and the Council , or at least the presidency , are more than just a hair &apos; s breadth apart ; this is serious , especially in the light of the Council &apos; s macho position on Austria .
there is regression in every sector of Chinese civil society .
it is a fact : China is the major threat , the major threat to us , the threat which we must confront , the threat to peace .
it is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese , the Chinese leadership , is Communist first and Chinese second .
China likes doublespeak .
until we have a firm position , we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities .
I think we need to seize the opportunity .
we need to associate ourselves with the American initiative .
we need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted .
we need to work .
the Fifteen need to start work right now , with all the members of the United Nations ; we need , at long last , to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position .
Mr President , I would like to try to put a different perspective to this .
as you know , on Monday an unmanned spacecraft went into orbit around a peanut-shaped asteroid called Eros which is not very far from earth .
Photographs show us that there is no life on the asteroid , but much further out in our galaxy , the Milky Way , there are about 300 billion stars , many with planets .
beyond the Milky Way there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets .
it is probable , therefore , that there is a lot of life out there , and much of it much more advanced than we are .
bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the nearest stars , I invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us .
what do they see ?
they see a beautiful planet , teeming with life , but they see its atmosphere being polluted and warming up .
they see forests being cut down and deserts spreading .
of the living creatures , they can see many animals that are treated cruelly , rare ones becoming extinct for ever .
how do they see the currently dominant species - that is us ?
well , they see the planet &apos;s resources being unevenly spread .
they see land being fought over , medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted , books for schools - but not at all in the least-developed areas of our world , 50 % of the world &apos;s population never making a telephone call in their whole life .
what do they see about the relationships between human beings ?
they see us killing each other .
they see us restricting each other &apos;s liberties .
they see a never-ending series of local wars . they see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers , or treated as prostitutes or slaves .
they see unequal treatment of men and women , of people of different ages , of minorities , of people of different coloured skins , of races , of beliefs , of immigrants , even neighbours .
we all know the picture .
the UN Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this .
we should salute it - and I think we do .
only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law .
here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights , which is being discussed at the moment , to become enforceable in law .
I say : shame on them !
human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world .
that is the goal which we have to work towards .
much , as Commissioner Patten said , remains to be done .
finally , if you asked me : what if there is no life out there among the stars , what if we are alone ? - which is an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say : do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly , before letting them go out to populate other planets ?
Mr President , human rights are universal , indivisible , interrelated and interwoven .
this well-known phrase , which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993 , is known off by heart by many .
that is positive .
but what about the human rights policy within the EU itself ?
does it reflect this vision of coherence ?
in fact , does the European Union have a human rights policy ?
this question does not challenge the efforts made by the Member States who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere , for example in China .
no , Mr President , I am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the European Union itself .
a new government has come into power in Austria , comprising a political party which has sent out a message of racism and intolerance vis-à-vis minorities .
human rights , which the EU embraces , are thus under threat , but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated .
the widely quoted Article 7 of the Treaty , which provides for the repeal of membership rights from a Member State where serious and continuous violations against human rights have been established , is , of course , only a kill or cure remedy , an ultimum remedium , which , in the case of Austria , can only be quoted in the absence of anything more effective , and by way of warning .
there is , therefore a need for a fully-fledged human rights policy for and by the European Union , a policy which promotes and enforces human rights within the EU itself .
such policy should comprise various components .
firstly : a regulatory framework is needed , which spells out very clearly the rights which the EU intends to secure for its citizens .
a start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter , but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists .
this is a political question which , in the short term , requires an answer from the IGC and this Parliament .
secondly : a range of instruments has to be developed which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark .
the following spring to mind in this respect : the systematic collation of documentation and information , professional forms of observation , the development of information campaigns , the use of cash to support democratic forces in the country concerned , a more creative deployment of the resources which are available through multilateral diplomacy , such as organised dialogue and fact finding missions and such like .
thirdly : it will need to be made clear for each of the EU institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the European Union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails .
the Commission and the Council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be .
this Parliament is excluded from this , for our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carries this responsibility .
but I am somewhat surprised that the resolution which should bring this debate on human rights to a conclusion has been prepared in the foreign sector of this Parliament and that the aforementioned Committee , of which I form part , has not been involved in this .
Mr President , this Parliament is fragmented and divided .
for the sake of our credibility , we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the EU are different from human rights elsewhere in the world .
I think that this will benefit our credibility in the UN Human Rights Committee .
Mr President , what will it take to make the debate on human rights something other than what it is today : an ideological instrument which helps to enslave peoples rather than free individuals ?
we must start by going beyond man , who is not the master of the universe , to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values , without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and bloodshed .
we need , in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of Europe , to go back to the natural order of the universe , i.e. to the Creation , and beyond that still further , to the Creator &apos; s intention .
then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family , the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens &apos; rights are only respected within sovereign states .
&apos;No freedom for the enemies of freedom &apos; was what the advocates of the revolutionary Terror were saying two centuries ago , the advocates of the revolution which proved , alas , to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regimes .
no human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the acolytes of the new world order are saying today , the new world order which reigns almost unchallenged in financial circles , in international institutions , in the media and cultural networks , and in educational institutions , to mention but a few .
I do not know if he is still present and can hear me .
what is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok , one of the most important parties in the Flemish region , if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopts the implausible , indecent and ignominious bill tabled by its main political rivals , the Volksunie , which seeks quite simply to abolish the party ?
what is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and publishers are persecuted , as the young historian Jean Plantin was just yesterday before the Court of Appeal , in my home town of Lyon - he was the subject of an absurd , arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout , the smug expression of straitjacketed thinking and intellectual conformism ?
it is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism , when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism .
in a word , I shall believe your talk about human rights in Europe , fellow Members , when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves .
I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem , i.e. Communism .
listen to the resounding voice of Solzhenitsyn in his letter to the Americans , in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of Western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism , an individualism which , far from allowing people to flourish , paves the way for future dictatorship , in fact the worst kind of dictatorship , because those whom it enslaves are not even aware of their terrible servitude .
Mr President , the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the 20th century .
the holocaust , fifty years ago , led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms .
since the end of the cold war , compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation .
leaders violating these principles now face international criticism , sanctions and are even brought to trial , such as ex-dictators like Mr Pinochet have experienced .
these developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very disquieting .
especially in situations of war , civilians are given less consideration all the time .
it seems contradictory .
never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed .
never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries .
yet the most basic rules of conduct are being flouted on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago .
women are systematically raped .
children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle .
Excesses are no longer the exception , they have unfortunately become the rule .
this applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide .
too late , too selective and too fragmented : this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community .
first of all , the policy comes too late .
both in Rwanda and Kosovo , the UN , despite the many warnings , appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres , as President Havel pointed out this afternoon .
fifty years later , we are still unable to prevent genocide .
we should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency .
control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this .
the human rights policy is also too selective .
the months of NATO bombardments of Kosovo and the mediation attempts in the Middle East are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in Africa .
I cannot shake off the impression that , when it comes to human rights , despite all the rhetoric , Africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency . this is something which I very much regret .
the impression that Africans get , namely that they are inferior world citizens , is not unfounded .
I would like to warn against a blurring of standards in the assessment of human rights situations in Africa , where violations are viewed as a necessary evil .
but above all , the human rights policy is too fragmented .
we are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or Europe .
take Sudan .
the international community is sending conflicting messages to this country .
Britain has re-opened its embassy in Khartoum .
Canada has invited the Sudanese for peace talks .
Europe puts the rebels in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time , Americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level .
there is a need for more coordination , more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided .
only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
Mr President , I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home .
but unfortunately , as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber , human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world .
sometimes the more we speak , the less we hear - motions : words ; conventions : words ; treaties : words - if we are not careful , words themselves become a substitute for real action .
words framed in inclusive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions which are often paraded as a testimony to a country &apos;s respect for and adherence to human rights .
yet words spoken , written or signed are not in themselves enough .
look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities , groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming .
can anyone argue with any persuasiveness that women are treated equally and fairly , that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion , belief , gender , disability , age , sexual orientation , opinion , political affiliation etc ?
the defamation of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination .
even within the EU citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions .
every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities .
quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created .
and so long as people do not have equality before the law , this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded .
in our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities .
we must not waiver in that commitment .
but we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies .
yes , conventions have been signed , but action is needed .
I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices , eternal vigilance , not just outside our borders but within .
that is why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken . because what happens in each Member State happens to every single one of us .
what happens in another part of the world affects us .
Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria .
human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked .
human rights do not exist in isolation , they are connected to our development policies , our economic policies , our home affairs policies , indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions .
I would repeat what Mr Patten said : we must engage , we must inform , educate and thereby effect real and lasting change .
Mr President , &quot; Europe stands for ideals , values and principles .
we must emphasise Europe &apos; s spiritual history .
together , we must re-establish the values which unite Europe .
spiritual values have been disseminated from Europe throughout the globe .
we must live with our consciences . &quot;
these were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic , Vaclav Havel .
in an extraordinarily edifying speech , characterised by wisdom , historical knowledge , an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe &apos; s spiritual and Christian heritage , he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity .
we should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe .
I wish to discuss two matters .
first of all , civil society .
Vaclav Havel stated that , in Eastern Europe , the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society : national movements , churches and the independent trade unions .
the same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches .
it is happening with Buddhism in Tibet .
we must never forget to defend civil society .
I also want to mention the death penalty .
like my own country , Sweden , the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal , unique and inviolable value of every human .
on the basis of this principle , human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves .
try telling that to the governments of the United States , Russia and China .
Mr President , President-in-Office , Commissioner , I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo , Mexico , Saudi Arabia , Sierra Leone and China .
in relation to China , we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked .
however , it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one , and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve .
however , if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva , then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources .
the financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat .
resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights , strategic planning , the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations .
to this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks .
the European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds .
in so doing , we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding , but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric .
Mr President , this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission &apos; s and Council &apos; s efforts in this respect .
I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister , and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda .
Cuba is the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this , with all due sympathy to Cuba .
it is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy .
I would , during my two minutes , like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart .
the first country is Indonesia .
we are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President .
we are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction .
but I can report that in the Moluccas , an area just north of Timor , the violence is still not under control .
this has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years .
tens of thousands of people are on the run .
the situation is badly managed .
I know that tomorrow , or the day after tomorrow , an important programme will be shown on Dutch television , in which an appeal will be made for observers . this is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on , so that at least a record can be made , not least for the future , for human rights committees , of what has been happening .
my urgent request , which has been echoed many times in resolutions , is the following : could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas ?
surely thousands of people killed , thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough .
my second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma .
surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma .
I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion .
for ten years now , the elected President of that country has been under house arrest .
and for ten years now , its parliament has been out of action .
numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma .
there are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention .
in my opinion , Burma should be put back on the agenda , too , certainly in the wake of Indonesia &apos; s U-turn .
surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch , even by Europe .
my request is , in fact , to put this country back on the top of the agenda .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union &apos; s status in the world .
one of the EU &apos; s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights , as exercised both within the Union and by our partners .
the European Parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights , and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self-interest and &quot; national interests &quot; , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the Member States and even by other European Union institutions .
we can therefore safely say , for example , that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten , which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people , who always opposed occupation by Indonesia .
by the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia , a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account .
but it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position .
it is vital that when violations are committed , the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity , whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola , in Cuba , China or Burma , whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers , humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister .
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia .
Justice needs to be done in East Timor .
President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with .
the specific reference in this resolution to East Timor , on the initiative of the PPE Group , is a timely one .
someone must be held to account for the events that took place there , some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House ; they cannot go unpunished .
it is impossible to talk about East Timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of Timorese refugees living on Indonesian soil in inhumane conditions , under the control of Indonesian soldiers and militias , and being used as bargaining chips .
this is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency .
I would also like to say that the European Parliament &apos; s participation in the preparatory work is important in establishing coherent European Union positions on various different issues , and that the presidency therefore naturally welcomes all the various suggestions and in particular all the contributions made through the resolutions which have been presented .
I would also like to stress , as many Members have highlighted , that human rights policy is at the heart of Europe &apos; s identity and that respect for human rights should be seen as a fundamental principle for international cooperation by the European Union .
hence the need for the most coherent European human rights policy possible , which of course means that we need to adopt clear and unambiguous positions where we consider a state of affairs to be unacceptable , and I have in mind , in particular , the references that many Members have made to China .
but we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other Members about other countries , notably Indonesia , East Timor , the Moluccas and Burma .
I could not conclude without mentioning Mr Van Hecke &apos; s speech in particular , in which he referred to the human rights situation in Africa and to the role and priorities of the Portuguese Presidency , and questioned the sincerity of the priority we are giving to relations with the European Union .
furthermore , I cannot stress enough the significance of our having concluded important negotiations on the new convention to succeed the Lomé Convention , and the fact that , following extremely complex and difficult negotiations , we have succeeded in organising - or making preparations for the organisation of - the first EU-Africa Summit .
for all these reasons I thought it essential to reply directly to Mr Van Hecke &apos; s question on this issue .
. Mr President , this has been a very useful debate .
one or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully .
for example , Mrs Maij-Weggen referred to both Indonesia and Burma and made some important points about both those countries and the human rights situation there .
what I would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate .
one of the very first speakers , Mr Wuori , spoke of the remarks made earlier today by Mr Havel .
it was a remarkable speech and I hope that Mr Gollnisch , who is no longer able to be with us , was able to hear that speech as well .
I also hope that , if there is any life in outer space , as has been speculated by Mr Newton Dunn , it was tuned in to Mr Havel &apos; s speech as well .
Mr Havel reminded us that the Union is not just about markets , about GDP growth , it is a Union of values that is reflected in the Treaties and is reflected in our obligations in the whole area of external assistance , reflected quite specifically in what we are charged to do .
how do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes ?
one or two honourable Members , Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan , spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality .
Mr Cashman said , which is right in a sense , that words are no substitute for real action .
of course , words can make a bit of a difference , a point that was made by Mrs Malmström .
she said that she had received a letter from the Chinese Ambassador , a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country , to tell her that she was wrong and the European Parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in China .
I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities .
she will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China .
I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations , many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today .
we will want to share with Parliament , as vicars say , our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead .
there is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca , who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate .
there is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy .
I want to remind Parliament that the Commission will be publishing , before the middle of the year , a comprehensive , intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy .
it is immensely important , and if I had not thought that already , having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion .
it has been a useful debate .
I hope we can have further debates like this .
I hope we can have , in particular , debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters , where people are still being tortured , where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this House takes for granted , as I do .
I have received 7 motions for resolution , pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present statement .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on Thursday .
Cyprus and Malta
the next item is the joint debate on :
the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus ;
Mr Seixas da Costa has the floor on behalf of the Council .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union , I would like to present to you certain information about the re-opening of the intra-Cyprus negotiations and recent developments in this area .
I think it will be obvious to everyone that the events in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relations between the European Union and Turkey have created a new backdrop , at Community level , which we cannot ignore when it comes to relations between the two Cypriot communities .
at the beginning of December 1999 , the first round of negotiations were held in New York , after an interruption of several years in negotiations between the Cypriot communities in the north and south of the island .
these negotiations took the form of indirect discussions mediated by the UN special representative , Álvaro de Soto .
a further round was held in January this year , starting on 31 January , and a third round is scheduled to start on 23 May in New York .
there is a possibility , which has not yet been absolutely confirmed , that continuous and direct discussions may take place , with work continuing until September this year .
these discussions essentially cover four areas : security , the structure of government , territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation , as a result of the situation following the partition of the island .
however , agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues , and the representative of the northern part of the island , Rauf Denktash , has suggested three new topics : sovereignty , confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island .
the second development which we regard as important is the statement made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day &apos; s discussions to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island .
this is the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis .
certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations , in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom , in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure , which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations .
this will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for 18 April .
furthermore , the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has decided , following the example of previous presidencies , to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue .
this representative has already contacted all these parties and has , in close cooperation with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds .
in particular , we intend that the European Union should maintain a constant profile on this issue , and of course all the more so since Cyprus is a candidate for membership of the European Union with negotiations at a fairly advanced stage . this naturally raises certain expectations and means that the role of the European Union is of some relevance in this context .
there is also another important aspect which I referred to at the beginning of my statement , and this relates to Turkey &apos; s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession .
we believe that it is not only necessary to read the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council with some care and attention , but that we should also take advantage of the willingness of the Turkish authorities to help to resolve this situation .
I was able to talk to Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit about this issue when I visited Ankara myself , and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with Turkey &apos; s particular approach to this question , I believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss .
this window of opportunity involves combining various factors , one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union .
this is key as regards the future of this issue .
on the other hand , we think it is important - and this is also linked with the way in which the European Union relates to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the Commission and the Cypriots in the north of the island should be encouraged . this would not , let me make this quite clear , imply any kind of formal recognition .
furthermore , this means that we in the Council - and I think that Parliament will join us in this - should encourage the Commission &apos; s involvement in this undertaking .
it is essential for us to send the Commission a message of confidence about its role in this area .
lastly , I believe - and this is also the presidency &apos; s intention - that we should continue to cooperate actively with the United Nations , given the skilful , intelligent and capable way in which the Secretary-General , and the UN organisation in general , have conducted these discussions , and in particular the way they have endeavoured to help to harmonise the two parties &apos; positions .
as I said at the beginning , the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council last December have had a visible impact on the way the positions of the various parties to this process have developed .
the Nicosia Government has expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions , which open up the way to accession to the European Union without solving the partition of the island beforehand .
nevertheless , I have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition , which will evidently imply some concessions .
this is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island .
on the other hand , the Turkish Cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that Turkey &apos; s application for membership of the European Union may lead to greater flexibility in Ankara &apos; s position on this .
I believe that , despite the fears that may be felt by the two communities on the island , these points , which could be viewed in a negative light by the authorities on both sides , may in the end justify hopes of an ultimate solution .
it is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present , which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister , Giorgios Papandreou , and the Turkish Foreign Minister , Ismail Cem .
we believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome .
as far as we , the Council presidency , are concerned , we will continue to follow these developments very closely , and we will certainly cooperate with the Secretary-General and his personal representative on this matter .
we will make the Community institutions aware of what we are able to do , and what is possible in general , as regards coordination , not just at political level but also as regards what the Commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process .
in particular , we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue .
Mr President , we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side , but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one suspecting that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition , even though you stressed that this is not the case .
for example , I would not refer to the government of Nicosia .
it is the Cypriot Government , Mr President-in-Office , not the government of Nicosia .
that government has proposed a way in which the Turkish Cypriot side can take part , and I think it would be right for the Council and the Commission to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to take part institutionally in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the Republic of Cyprus .
on the other hand , the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us .
I cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently , nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies .
nor can I understand the pressure applied by Parliament to include the funds in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy . how can the whole of the European Union treat , in this way , two small countries situated on its periphery ?
not only are they countries which the European Union needs , but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the Union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union .
as the Commissioner said , and I agree with him , it is a matter of political decision .
this is a small political decision which would bring major benefits , especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state , to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the Republic of Cyprus , genuinely , to be rid of occupying forces .
Mr President , we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta .
this proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and , once it is implemented , will replace the financial protocols which have now expired .
pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis .
the Commission &apos; s analysis has in fact shown that , although classified as high income countries by the World Bank , Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity .
it was pointed out , during the discussion of Mr Brok &apos; s excellent report in committee , that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest .
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that .
as far as Cyprus is concerned , part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the Greek and Turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all .
the declarations made on the Cyprus question by the Council and the Commission were therefore most opportune and I should like to thank the President of the Council and Commissioner Verheugen .
since 4 July 1990 , when Cyprus applied to join the EU , the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations .
in April 1999 , Parliament again reiterated its position that the accession of Cyprus should benefit the whole island , and help towards a political solution , but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution .
in other words , accession should not be held hostage to a political solution .
the two processes are separate processes .
this unequivocal position on the part of the European Parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy .
we must therefore welcome the fact that the Helsinki European Council put an end to the speculation and stated in its conclusions , and I quote , that &quot; If no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations , the Council &apos; s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition &quot; .
the position is clear and we must now hope that the improved climate surrounding relations between the European Union and Turkey and between Greece and Turkey will bear favourably on the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations .
the presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever .
on the contrary , it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when Cyprus joins the European Union and prepares for a turning point in its history .
Mr President , I want to say that I share the other rapporteurs &apos; delight at the fact that better opportunities are now to be glimpsed for making further progress in Cyprus in the light of the improvement in relations between Turkey and the EU and between Turkey and Greece .
however , I also think that we in the EU should be making a constructive contribution .
I also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements , which we must solve .
there is , of course , the question of pre-accession aid , and this belongs in category seven .
last year , Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four , and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe , as they , in fact , should be , according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit .
