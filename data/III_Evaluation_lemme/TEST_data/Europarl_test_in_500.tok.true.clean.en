at the same time , I would ask for the Azerbaijani Government to respect the right of freedom of expression of every citizen and to immediately drop the charges against the two young men , accused on the basis of fabricated evidence , as Mrs Lunacek mentioned earlier .
we have taken a different view as regards the observers .
Watts report ( A5-0140 / 2001 )
I voted against Mr Barroso &apos;s candidacy , above all , because I believe in a genuinely political Europe , which cannot be satisfied with a Commission bound by the desiderata of big business .
Documents received : see Minutes
the EU and G20 are making simple plans to slash grassroots incomes , to put grassroots property into the hands of big business and increase their profits , to increase the exploitation of the working class and to cut insurance and labour rights .
it is no longer possible to prevent cultural products being completely subject to market forces ( quotas ) ; the compromise rules arrived at for the new services , the guarantee funds , the independent producers and the criteria for establishing them as well as for the promotion of European products are reliant on extremely vague Commission promises .
( applause )
it would actually facilitate full budgetization before the end of 1999 of the allocations for the structural funds provided for the period 1993-1999 .
Mr Verhofstadt never said a truer word when he stated that a glass may be seen as half full or half empty .
nor do we understand why , in category 2 , you have reduced payment credits even though there might be several technical justifications for them .
I shall therefore keep your observations in mind .
there is much talk about the transparency of the Council , but nothing concrete is ever done .
it is no longer the time for words but for action , with the necessary resources , even if the scale of them should be exceptional .
this objective serves the interests of rights-holders and is reflected in the recommendation &apos;s regulations relating to administering transparency , resolving disputes , the responsibilities of copyright managers and the balanced representation of all categories of copyright-holders on the boards of CRMs .
here again , the Council is being particularly unreasonable .
it is completely unacceptable to torture animals in order to , supposedly , improve ourselves .
we will be on your side ensuring , together with the Commission and President-in-Office Winkler , that Europe will ensure open doors and dialogue and , hopefully , open doors once again over the next three months .
I see this test as a means of giving a very strong impetus to the necessary reforms .
if we were to vote against the proposal , then we would ultimately get even less from it .
would you also be prepared to define the criteria you applied in establishing whether or not the group was a terrorist organisation ?
that is why I have voted in favour of the Scheele report .
far from this being a financial act of mercy , the overall health of our economic development is dependent on rural areas not being left behind .
the Lisbon Strategy has been successful , especially in regional and urban environments , in bringing Europe closer together .
. we voted in favour of this report , as it focuses on an issue on which there is broad agreement .
Madam President , thank you first of all for what you have said by way of an explanation .
however , we have a moral obligation to draw attention to this situation and we have to stand up and be counted on an issue as important as this .
the number of farmers growing GMOs is increasing every year .
I should like to close by saying that , otherwise , instead of talking about a Council of Ministers for Employment , we shall be talking about a Council of Ministers for Unemployment .
Sixthly , why , in its answer to my written question dated 15 June of this year , was the Commission unable to tell me the number of pupils with Category I entitlement within a 100 km radius of the school ?
( Parliament rejected the request by roll-call vote )
at the same time , however , security is also a basic requirement for prosperity and growth and , as such , indispensable for achieving the economic policy goals of the Lisbon Agenda .
with its accession to the European Convention , the EU &apos;s institutions will be subject to the administration of justice by the European Court of Human Rights . this will guarantee the independent external monitoring of the EU &apos;s respect for people &apos;s fundamental rights and freedoms .
for that reason , it is very satisfying to note that Sweden , as the country holding the presidency , has indicated its desire to help steer the work of the Council in a specifically more transparent direction .
this means that the European Heritage Label should not be the sum of the places selected by the Member States , but rather it should reflect a common European vision .
I should like to point out as rapporteur that certain proposals of the Agriculture Committee ought to be re-examined to get things in proportion .
action now will pay dividends in the future .
as I said in my opening remarks , the Commission very much appreciates the contribution made by the European Parliament to the debate on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud .
he will go on and on negotiating until we eventually get fed up with the stubborn Albanians not letting him take them to the cleaners .
a ‘ no ’ from our group would have been enough to throw the report out .
without the resources , we cannot serve our citizens .
by making available to all the means for active participation and considering access to it as a citizens &apos; right and an obligation of general interest for the Member States , we can ensure that this Information Society is actually created for the citizens and around the citizens .
life continues , and so does its negative sides .
I do not feel able fully to support Mr Seppänen &apos;s report on the Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans and loan guarantees for projects outside the Community , but nor do I intend to vote against it .
so , Mr Elles , I maintain my position , and I have been in politics long enough to know what it should be .
I thank the rapporteur and the Commission for putting this protective directive before the saving consumers of Europe .
so , we must have the courage to lay the blame on those who exploit them and we must stop blaming the immigrants by turning them into scapegoats .
a decision to introduce coins containing nickel in the outer layers could prove very difficult to change and could cause serious health problems for a growing proportion of Europe &apos;s population , particularly for women , since they are often dominant in the professions where nickel coins are handled .
this has resulted in some very good publicity for Parliament .
in this too , moreover , we are not in agreement with the Council .
I mentioned Raytheon because it is ironic that , in spite of the peace process in Northern Ireland , Nobel peace prize winners stood on a platform welcoming into Derry Raytheon , one of the world &apos;s biggest arms manufacturing companies .
this dialogue is principally pursued through the heads of the EU missions in the countries concerned .
in other words , firstly we can ask whether we need this Fund .
violence against women is unfortunately a part of the welfare state and can affect all of us regardless of age , environment and social class .
those who have taken it upon themselves to represent the interests of detainees should prove first and foremost that they no longer intend to risk the lives or welfare of the detainees .
I know of no cases in which human rights are being violated as a result of action by religious communities .
a varied approach is advocated , depending on the circumstances , which – as is rightly emphasised – must respect freedom of choice and facilitate the exercise of the fundamental human right of European families to have as many children as they wish , without the obstacles raised by the difficulty of combining a professional and family life .
many political activists are in prison , and the opposition party has decided to boycott the elections completely .
various Member States are preparing to draw up their own legal regimes for hosting this kind of investment .
I should like to say here that I welcome the Commission &apos;s inclusion of Parliament in the consultation process at this point in time , but that Parliament will have to make joint decisions on these issues in future on a fairly regular basis .
I believe that we are engaged in a process in which decisions have been taken and in which we now have a considerable technological and industrial mechanism to implement .
I also wish to say that these issues will be discussed by representatives of the European Union at the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation , which opens on 25 September .
on 1 March 2002 , the Basque Parliament adopted a &apos; non-legislative proposal &apos; drawing attention to the various positions adopted within the European institutions on internal political conflicts in the EU , such as the European Parliament &apos;s Reding report of November 1996 and Watson report of November 2001 .
there are other problems in relation to irrecoverable VAT which , sadly , we cannot solve with this report but are also very important .
Campaigns for different types of products should be paid for by the food industry and not through Community funds .
the more beneficial social systems , like the French labour law , are therefore not challenged and will remain enforceable .
OLAF &apos;s work raises the prestige of European institutions in its own right .
it was always the case , though , that everyone could talk to everyone else , in the same fora , and that all Members had the opportunity of joining in .
the aim is to offer this option to parents who want it .
Secondly , the European Union must start discussions again with the United States , as part of a transatlantic leadership , and with other leading world powers .
after having spoken to us in previous years of parallel medicine , complementary techniques , alternative therapies , now he is telling us of non-conventional medicines , in the hope that we will forget that behind this word are hidden esoteric notions - shiatsu , sikh , and others .
the setting up of the rapid reaction force seems to be coming on apace , for which we extend our compliments .
the real question is why there are so many people in prison .
the members of this committee urged the European Commission to table a directive on overall security of port facilities before the end of 2003 .
this being so , it makes no sense to stand and watch the machinations going on in the Middle East , the clashes , the destruction , the loss of human life on all sides .
we know full well that those asylum seekers include many economic migrants who &apos; slip &apos; into these mixed migratory flows .
the cornerstone , however , should be a careful assessment of experience to date in mutual communications between the EU and Belarus , on the basis of which the experience could be incorporated into a strategic plan clearly reflecting EU foreign policy on this country .
I hope so , and I hope that this will be a strong signal that makes you sit up and listen .
they cannot get away from this fact .
the number of deaths stood at 2 900 , while the estimated number of cases attributable to seasonal influenza amounts to 40 000 per year .
so I really believe that all those elements are working closely together for the betterment of our society and of our economy .
the main items on the agenda will be the priority areas agreed at the Ministerial Meeting in Tampere , namely immigration and development , legal migration and the fight against illegal migration .
I am sure that is what we will say tomorrow .
that is why I would particularly like to thank , for their extremely constructive and positive cooperation , Commissioner Danuta Hübner , the representatives of DG REGIO , the representatives of the successive presidencies , especially the Austrian Presidency , the secretariat of the Committee on Regional Development , the political advisors and also my collaborators and experts from Poland .
the honourable Member also raised the matter of Kosovo .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the summer , the Commission adopted the Council &apos;s recommendation urging the Member States of the EU to engage in joint programming of research into neurodegenerative diseases .
in the Middle East , a constant source of tension , the issue has to be resolved by the establishment of two sovereign states - Israel and Palestine - with absolute security guarantees for both .
the spirit of Nice is also hovering over the lengthy list of bridges and motorways which the Italian Presidency and Commissioner de Palacio wish to give us .
such an irregularity can be of a financial nature , but it can also be , for example , a breach of an environmental regulation , in which case no financial loss whatever is incurred .
you acknowledged yourself , Commissioner , that the World Summit on the Information Society produced valuable results ; it also had a spin-off , a focusing effect .
one significant topic in discussions during this discharge procedure has been - and still is - the methodology on the basis of which the European Court of Auditors decides whether or not to grant a Statement of Assurance .
Supervision of their public finances is essential to ensure that their commitments , which are greater in the euro zone , are fulfilled and that our shared aims are achieved .
there were 19 cases of suspension of the activities of independent media outlets .
Mr President , Commissioner , in my view , our debate today concerns a highly sensitive issue : the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography .
as committed and dedicated Europeans is this not the credo of our daily lives - to bring all European peoples together in friendship , peace and reconciliation , in a spirit of tolerance and mutual respect , fulfilling the guiding principles of our Treaty .
the principal issues relate to security of supply and technological efficiency in the use of available energy sources .
if people are persecuted in their own countries by non-government bodies and they can still live safely elsewhere in the country , then they need not necessarily be brought to Amsterdam . they can simply stay in Turkey or Russia .
one of the recitals of this report read : &apos; whereas the European Union recognised KEDO as a major industrial project constituting a vital contribution to nuclear non-proliferation and peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and , following negotiations with the founder members , signed an agreement &apos; .
your second task which will affect matters in the long term is the restructuring of the European Union .
there is no freedom of opinion or of the press ; the Internet is censored and independent newspapers closed down .
we have focused on the Irish presidency because the ball is currently in its court .
Paragraph 1 names a whole list of countries in which breaches of human rights take place , and which the report particularly wants to point out .
we must remember that it is , in particular , children and young people who have ferrets as pets .
the statement by the Dutch Presidency and the Commission on the results of the elections are , in our opinion , yet more pressure on and coercion of the government of Belarus .
3 .
I sincerely believe that the cohesion policy will be a vital instrument in achieving the Europe 2020 objectives , which is why I voted for this report .
question No 3 by ( H-0520 / 01 ) :
in 1997 , this figure stood at 45 % , and today will be even higher .
we therefore welcome the albeit belated common position adopted by the General Affairs Council .
I thank you again for this comprehensive report .
the EU is also agreed that the outcome of the round must be approved as one package and by all WTO Members .
for this reason I voted in favour of the resolution .
this is how we can primarily help maintain flight safety , the cornerstone of our foreign policy , and this is how we can indirectly facilitate the implementation of environmental and competition priorities .
it was confused .
I should like to emphasise in particular that traditional oenological practices really have been taken into account .
this is a threat to the standards and levels that already exist in many Member States .
these are real success stories .
I am in favour of the proposed guidelines .
there is a danger of matters becoming rather ridiculous when the EU goes in for such things .
( de ) Mr President , Commissioner , it is said regularly - in the Commissioner &apos;s speeches , for example - that Europe should concentrate on the essentials and that our aim is to bring Europe closer to its citizens .
the most important question still to be settled is on procedural aspects of the complaints procedure .
I am concerned to see that because we need greater safety at sea we are actually including other forms of transport as well .
ladies and gentlemen , do we really need this directive ?
it is going to be taken into consideration when we prepare the victims package .
I also think it is important to recognise informal learning acquired by workers , in order to enable them to change jobs more easily .
there was no overview of the internal and external audit reports , and the archive was also in something of a mess .
over the past year , Israel and its citizens have been increasingly faced with the deadly combination of these two factors .
I find the very idea that the West and Europe consider Islam Karimov an ally to be genuinely concerning , because no one who uses terrorist methods against his own people can be considered an ally .
peace and development in the areas of the world facing crisis are also what we must strive for .
I entirely agree with the rapporteur , who has given us a detailed and constructive report that reflects excellent expert knowledge of the issues .
at the same time , we have committed to maintaining fully accommodating liquidity support to the euro area banking system until at least October this year .
I would like to say a few words to my dear friend , Brian Crowley .
we face enormous difficulties and , without the will of the Member States , we will not be able to overcome them .
my sixth point , last but not least , is concern for the consumer .
first and foremost , the voluntary approach introduced in the Commission &apos;s proposal represents a substantial improvement compared to the current status .
in writing . - Parliament today voted for a change in the legal basis for legislation on radioactive contamination in foodstuffs .
this is a situation which causes problems of access to generic medicinal products .
but it would seem that there are always problems with this in practice .
I heartily welcome the efforts of the Commission to try to tackle the deliberate abuse of the VAT system by criminal gangs who seek to take advantage of the shortcomings in the system .
I wish and hope that this challenge will be taken up seriously by all the parties .
the fact that the source of this outbreak is still unclear and that the search for answers has , at times , seemed haphazard , means that consumer confidence is eroding fast .
question No 15 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis ( H-0956 / 96 )
the events during that period have shown that the people of Ukraine are committed to democracy and also that the EU Member States , by acting together , can play an important role .
the consumer will never discover what he has eaten .
it is important and good that we have gathered together so many excellent rapporteurs .
Mr President , the Middle East is the spiritual home of the three great revealed religions of the world , but sadly also the inspiration for those misguided few who invoke Islam as a justification for terrorist killings , invoking in particular the bloodthirsty traditions of Salafism and Wahhabism .
we have our three million olive trees .
can it be that this humble Parliament has more resources , more power , more intelligence or more possibilities than the Commission ?
the following questions are addressed to the Council .
I should also like to say a couple of words about the discharge decision where Parliament is concerned .
Mr President , I have two questions .
according to this procedure , framework legislation is adopted by the EU institutions whilst technical details are delegated to the different committees in the comitology and to the European groups of supervisors who , in turn , delegate in very close dialogue and consultation with market operators and other stakeholders .
this is not the same amendment that was rejected in committee .
Imbalances remain between men and women in the field of training and employment in the new ICT and I therefore voted in favour of the report .
Developing a knowledge-based economy is the only means of enhancing the competitiveness of the European economy .
I have voted for the recommendation , in the hope that the Member States will take more resolute steps .
this in turn will put the start of accession talks with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe at risk .
the joint debate is closed .
unfortunately , the audit process revealed cancellations and delays in procurement procedures , recurrent delays in the execution of payments and significant changes made to the work programme during the year .
the European Parliament is explicitly confirming the Commission &apos;s position to guarantee a more favourable position for Portugal &apos;s interests .
so there is a possibility of work between the European institutions and the Member States .
to invoke the Treaty of Lisbon is therefore an expression of unacceptable arrogance .
I shall continue to remind you of the worrying predictions made by scientists regarding the climate change that is , to a great extent , caused by road transport .
I think we need to consider urban charging , as well as how the revenue generated is used .
I am pleased that Richard Howitt and many other Members brought that up as well .
finally , the Commission wishes to congratulate the European Parliament , and particularly Mrs Aelvoet , on the excellent work of the committees that studied the Agreement .
&apos;The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity shall collect all relevant information regarding the implementation of the network codes and submit it to the Agency for evaluation ; &apos; .
Katiforis report ( A5-0352 / 2001 )
action taken on Parliament &apos;s positions and resolutions : see Minutes
to Mr Suominen I wish to say that we are maintaining close contact with Lithuania and Russia .
in this way , it is made possible for the market to reward them .
Mr President , Commissioner , may I express my thanks to Mrs Novak and her predecessor , Mrs Zissener .
it appears that civic authorities in Spain , in cahoots with grasping , unscrupulous developers , have been a terror to those who thought they were buying legitimate homes and properties , and , if this report helps address that , then it can only do good .
next week the Council ( and I am sorry the minister is no longer here ) will have the opportunity to sign off a common position on the Telecoms package that will pave the way for that investment .
we have already seen how animal nutrition has significance for people &apos; s health , but the ways in which we treat animals and the methods and systems we use to feed and transport them in fact affect public health as directly as does poor animal feed .
we have shared too much pain over the years .
there are in fact many levels : that of the regional fisheries organisations , that of the Member States , the European level ; it is at all these levels that action must be taken , across the board , with the involvement of the Directorate-General for Fisheries and the Directorate-General for the Environment , the Directorate-General for Development and the Directorate-General for Trade .
this is yet another exercise in avoiding doing anything , whilst , at the same time , very practical preparations are going ahead in other areas .
we must continue to encourage the authorities to make sure that the investigations are adequately carried out and that the perpetrators are brought to justice in a timely manner .
when it comes to the interests of German distillers and the interests of our cultural landscape , I appeal to Mrs Künast , the German Federal Minister for Consumer Protection , Food and Agriculture , to vote on 27 June in such a way as to achieve unanimity in this matter .
this would enable us to move towards regulating the protection of the economic rights of private individuals and removing the burden of bureaucracy imposed on them by the cumbersome traditional legal machinery .
however , the question that we are all asking in today &apos;s debate is if , in fact , there is a common foreign policy .
I would refer to the hearing , convened by the Commission , which took place yesterday and dealt with the issue of a regulatory framework for broadcasting and telecommunications , on the basis of a study whose contents can only be described as extremely disappointing .
Mr President , I am now in my sixth year in the European Parliament , and although I do not want to lecture anyone , good manners dictate that on this key matter it is necessary to seek the opinion of the rapporteur .
I congratulate the rapporteur on the proposals presented in the report , which I consider to be crucial for harmonising procedural guarantees in all Member States and for reinforcing the protection of fundamental rights , such as the right to a defence and the right to a trial .
we can , of course , publish guidelines referring to existing provisions on such things as air , noise , waste , and so on ; we can encourage the sharing of experience and support it , including financially , for we know that not everyone has to keep on reinventing the wheel .
to sum up , there is only a problem with the Council .
as indicated in the Council &apos;s conclusions of July 2004 , this contribution must be fair , balanced and non-discriminatory .
I am therefore appealing in particular this morning to Mrs Roure to take account of what I am saying , because the support of the second largest group in the House and the other groups here is very important .
in writing . - ( IT ) We have no option but to vote in favour of the report on the role of women in agriculture and in rural areas because we still believe in the professional farmer who lives from the income derived from his own business .
in my opinion , consumers should be the ones who benefit from the possible advantages of this process .
it is the interests of all of us that he delivers what he says he will .
however , I believe that this chance must also be provided to the Hungarian community in Romania , who have already had their fair share of political window-dressing , but what they actually see is that only a few of the essential issues have been solved .
Numerous newspapers are being closed down daily and unfortunately the number of executions has increased significantly .
Russia is supplying Eritrea with arms through Antwerp whilst we , the European Community , are in the midst of this conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia .
as a referee the Commission will monitor compliance with its recommendation and assess its effectiveness .
I call upon the administration to check this very carefully , and I must insist that , as is quite right , it should be Parliament , its Members and committees that decide , and not some officials who take it upon themselves to do this by altering the procedural page .
in this respect , however , the Council has made a fundamental error of judgement , since if the Council does not eventually establish the legal base , the Committee on Budgets , under the Notenboom procedure , will distribute the funds available to other budget lines .
these conclusions will help serve as the basis for the Council &apos;s instructions to the Commission , the Member States and other stakeholders for implementing the measures contained in the Commission &apos;s Action Plan .
in our work on the summit , we are discussing with the US how to move towards closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism , especially in the light of the plans to close Guantánamo .
with regard to child protection policy , certain proposals should be highlighted .
the work of youth associations is important for social engagement and helps young people progress , both in terms of substance and personally .
the first decisions taken by the government seem to point in the right direction .
Dayton was the result , and led - as we believed - to the founding of a new state . this was and probably remains the only option to bring peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina at this time .
these types of violence must also be prosecuted with greater determination in the EU .
Madam President , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy expresses its satisfaction with the Commission &apos;s Green Paper on copyright and related rights in the information society .
Nevertheless , an extremely important element for environmental protection should refer to the treatment of water used to cool reactors .
however , I made a point of stressing the need for the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission , a coordinating and research body which deals with the management of resources , to become operational as soon as possible .
those ideals had been shared by peoples the world over , especially the cream of international youth , whom they inspired .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m .
we recently had a glaring example , with serious consequences , of this lack of liaison in communication , intelligence and information activities between the bodies operating in the countries of Europe .
my reply is the same as the one I would give to those who fear excessive outflows in the absence of prior authorisation for hospital care , which is that the intention of this proposal is not to promote patient mobility .
Mr Laschet ’ s report is quite right to remind us that respect for the system of the United Nations is the best way to bring about security and peace in the world .
( for the results and other details on the vote : see Minutes )
so , if the conditions are satisfied , implementation will begin in the present quota year , that is to say 2008 .
what remains unreported or unknown is anybody &apos;s guess .
the number one priority must be the reform agenda .
in our view , external relations ought to be based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states , and not on creating spheres of influence .
the overriding goal should be to treat intellectual property rights in a manner that allows access to technology at affordable prices .
according to the Government of Spain it is only EUR 436 million .
would he also accept that most of the complaints that the Court of Auditors brings forward concern systems and procedures , and not fraud in its narrow sense , and that if fraud does occur it is generally in donor countries or , indeed , sometimes in the Member States of the European Union ?
it would , then , have made sense for him to do so at an earlier stage , but if it is to be done now , that should be enough , and combating them with all vigour should be seen as a precondition , just as much as Israel &apos; s refraining from hampering subsequent development by riddling the infrastructure in Palestine with bullet holes .
. we welcome any attempts , provided they are workable , to improve safety and health at work .
Mr Solana , if you are to speak on behalf of the European Union , we must show a united front . so what is the state of affairs ?
we must give very serious consideration to ways of preventing these crimes .
they state that the Commission should take steps on the basis of Community law .
the analysis for the year is in many respects a follow-up to the sterling work carried out a year ago by Mr Lipietz .
as such , I only hope that the EU negotiators stamp their authority on the discussions , thus immediately authenticating the WTO &apos; s fundamental right of existence as an international organisation now and in the future .
however , if it is approved as it stands now , it will be difficult for you to keep your promise .
in my opinion , the Belgian presidency should be very grateful for your contribution to the debate .
Mr President , let me emphasise that Mrs García Arias was able to experience the openness and receptiveness of the Commission in person when she took an interest in discussing the problems of the HUNOSA company .
we were building bridges ; in Mexico , we also received many positive reactions to the fact that the European Union had taken the lead and that we had genuinely tried to bring several different positions closer to each other .
one of these was that we called upon the Commission to submit proposals in order to give railway undertakings the right of free access to railway infrastructure on the basis of an amendment to Article 10 of Directive 91 / 440 / EEC regarding the operation of international freight transport , along with accompanying measures .
with this in mind , the Commission has come forward with some constructive workable ideas which I hope will provide a sound basis for a much improved regime .
for the enormous majority of the 380 million Europeans of the Union , of all backgrounds , national , ethnic , religious or political , you embody peace and tolerance between nations and religions , as well as the wise ideals of Buddhism , of which you are the highest spiritual authority .
even if this figure were lower , that would , in my eyes , justify going ahead with the debate on this issue in order to encourage the activities of European micro-entities .
the economy is very important also for consumers .
the use of this instrument must be avoided , and at all costs must remain limited to very exceptional circumstances .
I shall confine my address to the recommendations concerning employment and growth , which mark a leap forward that we should greet with enthusiasm .
might the repressive means that the democracies are sometimes compelled to use in the fight for democracy and the open society also constitute a threat to the values we are defending ?
the actual effect of a measure such as that before us tonight will clearly be to drive this art business out of Europe completely and into the welcoming arms of Switzerland and New York .
the people of Iran alone have the jurisdiction to resolve any serious political issues which exist in Iran .
Closure of the sitting
I can , with a certain amount of resignation , state that there is much still to be done .
the drafting procedure adds legitimacy to the decision-making process .
( BG ) Minister , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to assure you that today &apos;s debate on the three reports is of major interest both to the European Union &apos;s citizens and my fellow lawyers .
clearly , this situation will continue until we are in a new phase that offers brighter prospects , which is vital for new business and investment strategies .
however , how the substance got into the products is not clear .
given the progress made in discussions within the Council this very afternoon , I feel that we can say that an agreement on this proposal for a regulation is now within reach , and I am pleased to say that this has been made possible thanks to a very broad consensus between Parliament and the Commission , of which Mr Berend was one of the architects .
on climate change and energy , the alternative is clear : either our Member States are convinced that they must progress and set an example ahead of the Copenhagen Summit , and if so , we must make clear decisions before December to ensure reciprocity from our international partners , or they have decided that , despite worsening climatic conditions and our energy dependence , there is no need to take urgent action .
I know that this requires unanimity in the Council , but it would be scandalous and incomprehensible for the Member States to oppose legislation of this kind .
I believe that achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important , interlinked factors such as health , education , culture , jobs , housing and environmental condition .
where our own policy is concerned , we need to adjust the economic regulations so that we provide sufficient positive incentives for the far more efficient management of energy and materials .
thank you .
let me turn to the report of Mrs Kaufmann , which explains clearly how the Citizens &apos; Initiative can bring a new dimension to democracy in the Union .
I am the servant of the political groups in the matter of deciding the agenda , and , in view of the fact that this is a joint debate and not just a debate on reports , it seems to me that it is within the discretion of the groups to seek to order the debate as they have done .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights - I have had the opportunity to talk about this in many places - is of interest to people , because they understand and feel strongly about fundamental rights .
our common objective must therefore be to create the conditions for consumers that allow them to have the same confidence when making a purchase in another country as they have when doing so at home .
you are undermining things with the rendez-vous clause , including the 20 % target .
Mr President , in the reply to our contributions yesterday to the Lannoye Report and in particular to the proposal concerning honey , Commissioner Bangemann replied that it was not the objective of labelling to settle questions relating to the quality of the products , or even measures to support the beekeepers .
so the rapporteur is quite right to question our own system .
that was a political demonstration .
I mentioned insulin earlier , which is used to treat insulin-dependent diabetes , but which , by definition , cannot be used in the other type .
EU election assistance and observation
the common position is well-balanced to my mind and was improved on , to some extent , by the committee &apos; s amendments and those tabled by the rapporteur , Mrs Peijs , whom I would like to thank .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , it is a pleasure to be here today to talk about children and also about the report you will adopt shortly .
the agreement negotiated with the Swiss authorities by the Commission is quite adequate : it extends the benefits of the programmes to Switzerland , while safeguarding the financial and other interests of the EU .
not as a special offer , mind you , but as the speciality of the house !
you perhaps know that Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek also visited Kishinev yesterday .
let us also retain a sensible flexibility when it comes to the details of selecting fruit or vegetables , remembering that it is intended to promote our children &apos;s health in the best possible way .
this is the right approach , but it is not enough just to reform the labour market and pensions .
– Services of general economic interest , with the distinction between their economic and non-economic aspects , are in the sights of big business , with a view to commercialising the satisfaction of basic grassroots needs and increasing their profits .
one of these points is the European Group on Ethics .
however , to do so , you have had to accept being yoked together with the governments concerned .
the document describes in a reasonably clear way how the Commission spent the funds available to it during 2001 , both in the field of development cooperation and with regard to humanitarian aid .
to Sasha , the judge from Nis , who died somewhere near Split after dreadful torture , as we heard later .
we have also succeeded in turning Europe into an oasis of stability , progress , peace and democracy that is now the envy of the rest of the world .
for that reason , I wish to ask whether the Commission and the Council are aware that the biggest problems are in any case disputes over the custody and the abduction of children when one of the parents comes from outside the EU and a country that has not ratified the Hague Convention .
I want to draw attention to one principle which I fully endorse : the principle of &apos; one person-one passport &apos; .
this is true of many areas , of course , as - even though this has not had a decisive influence on the present discussion - there is currently a wave of migration not only from South to North , but also from East to West .
it enables our concerns to be refocused on the consumer , even if not as completely as we would like , and that in itself is very important .
I agree with the rapporteur , Mr Miller , that Member States in breach of their obligations should be condemned more frequently , expeditiously and severely than is now the case , by imposing fines , for example .
Thirdly , notification should have a practical purpose and should complement the analysis of the development of the European gas system .
a European Union version of the United States &apos; National Children &apos;s Study , which the Parliament has requested , would cost about EUR 100 million per year .
we are particularly proud of this , because - as I am sure you can imagine - not everyone was enthusiastic about it .
we are making progress , and the Staes report shows this very clearly .
to do so would be to challenge the effectiveness of decision-making in this Parliament .
the Union should cooperate with the Member States to promote a policy of sustainable transport , using fiscal incentives , supporting projects and completing integrated systems .
the new directive differs from the previous practice of interregional cooperation in that such cooperation will have to be carried out at a higher level .
( de ) Mr President , Commissioner , I believe alcohol was dangerous in the past and alcohol is dangerous today .
it should simplify the cross-border sale of insurance services , make it easier to compare products , and lead to a reduction in costs .
it is the typical style we have come to expect from him - combative and taking no hostages when he is fighting particular causes .
therefore , our message for the EU-China summit should be that there will be no automatic progress in economic relations without real progress in the rule of law .
Commissioner , we know that there will be no peace between Palestine and Israel , or in the Middle East , as long as the Syrian occupation of Lebanon – an offence to the principle of legitimate sovereignty – persists .
I have two questions for you about this .
AAL is not just about improving independent living but can also contribute to achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy .
in Iraq , terrorism kills many people everyday , in a constant drip .
these are , as far as I am aware , obsolete .
for too long companies have been able to force consumers to pay over the odds for their gas and electricity .
it was pleased to see that , at the vote in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , a clear majority emerged in favour of providing Community funding for research projects involving the procurement of human embryonic stem cells from supernumerary embryos and therefore the creation of new lines .
today it is part of what we call the hidden economy and this has a negative effect on those who carry it out and also on states &apos; finances .
I quote : ‘ The governments of the Federal Republic of Germany , Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg and the Netherlands firmly believe that the time has come to take a further step towards a united Europe ’ .
I would like to thank again my colleagues , the shadow rapporteurs , with whom we cooperated very well .
this Declaration already stated - in Article 2 - that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms without distinction of any kind , and sex is expressly mentioned .
Watts report ( A5-0343 / 2000 )
I would ask the honourable Member to be patient and wait until July when the Commission will make its proposal on the medium term revision of the common agricultural policy , in accordance with the financial perspective and what was agreed in Berlin in 2000 .
we will benefit in the long run , and that is a disincentive for taking measures when benefits will appear sometime in the future .
well , there are a small number of points , but some of them are important in terms of content .
now I hear that there is going to be such a working document , which sounds very good .
the judicial authorities cannot afford to lag behind if they are to combat it .
it would be much more effective if , instead of mediators , instead of a multiplicity of opinions , we set about creating one body , in which all the institutions could participate and which would be headed by an individual with a proven knowledge of foreign policy and of the problems of the region . we would then get far more results .
Closure of the sitting
are we simply waiting until something goes wrong , or are we really trying to prevent this ?
an excellent report , which reflects the criticism of the current state of human rights in the world .
the forward line of troops will be given the opportunity to engage in still higher levels of cooperation : when the EU &apos;s crisis management is extended to include the work of combat forces this may be done illegally without a mandate from the United Nations and irrespective of geographical borders .
in conclusion , people at Zaventem , and at Brussels more generally , are expecting solutions to these problems and we hope that the Commission will listen to what we have to say .
this year a very high percentage of borrowers has stopped paying the instalments owed , placing the entire system in crisis .
the President of the Italian Parliament , Mr Pivetti , came here to testify to the interest Italian Members of Parliament take in their European colleagues .
you will discuss it next week with Council because , if I understand correctly , we currently lack a qualified majority .
for the majority of people in Belarus , resonant phrases about a constructive dialogue and the discussion of fundamental problems failed to show clearly what policy the European Union will pursue in the future .
we now have a legally binding charter which is part of the EU &apos;s primary legislation .
it was merely to be agreed .
the Commission is also awaiting an opinion expected in October from the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on densities and travelling times .
Meanwhile , a lack of clarity exists in the attempt to make the Member States responsible for monitoring vessels in non-Community waters , particularly in waters which are subject to international conventions . there are no plans to allocate additional funds and operational problems could occur .
the EU imports an estimated two million birds each year .
( de ) Mr President , I apologise for taking the floor once again .
we believe that this decision is completely contradictory to the regulation and we regret it all the more because this is the second time this has happened this week .
I expect a rapid response from the EU institutions to the opinion of the Venice Commission on the Hungarian constitution .
as for the plans relating to immigration and the right of asylum , which need to be finalised in the course of the next six months , revulsion is the only possible response to the idea that this ultra-sensitive debate might be sullied by the barbarous cries of rage to which one of the personalities in the current coalition is frequently given .
internal state authorities can also regulate this to whatever extent they think necessary .
the 1995 Declaration was a landmark and much of it remains valid today . but it still requires much in the way of implementation .
Mr President , I will naturally begin by reiterating our solidarity with the Members from the Popular Party , while at the same time - although I find it difficult to say - pointing out that our democratic response today in the face of this latest murder should be to overcome our grief and continue working in this House , as we are at the moment .
Mr President , for centuries , Belarus tended to see itself as part of Central Europe and had a close relationship with what is now our Community , but the twentieth century dealt it some appalling blows .
allow me to make a specific point on the minority law issue in Romania .
Europe has a special responsibility to the Balkans and the south of the Mediterranean .
I am very pleased about that and I thank my fellow Members , but these are insufficient , especially in relation to the principles of proportionality and necessity , which must always prevail when rights and freedoms are at stake .
if you do succeed , you will trap those southern countries inside an economic prison , in which people &apos;s suffering will be untold , while the northern countries will find themselves paying , forever , a massive bill and interest rates that are far too high for their own economies .
in the field of bus , coach and maritime transport , for which we are now laying down rules , we may encounter problems assigning responsibilities when it comes to maritime transport and the ports - but this must be given a practice-based solution in future .
we cannot agree , either , with the proposal &apos;s encouragement of &apos; public-private partnerships &apos; , which are an instrument used to privatise public services that are essential and strategic for the people and the socioeconomic development of each Member State .
he wants to know what his life will be like at the end of the month .
many Internet users , particularly parents , are completely oblivious to the risks their children run on the Internet .
we have to start today to think about the Europe that we want in the future , and it is in this pragmatic , open and , hopefully , transparent vein that I have faith in this Finnish Presidency .
we , too , had our doubts about the potential effect of this measure in the flood-stricken areas .
the initiative of Sweden , which has agreed to grant refugee status to 9 000 Iraqis , is to be commended .
this is a genuine request .
if the Kosovar Albanians have to be accommodated , they should go to Albania or Turkey . they should not be placed in western Europe whose economic and social advantages attract anyone and everyone , thus leading to migratory influxes which are as harmful to the host country as to the country of origin .
we made a major breakthrough this July .
in this information note we have outlined a number of specific measures that we can propose .
we have to think carefully about the choices we need to make to relaunch the Lisbon strategy and also about the Union ’ s financial perspective : that is , the resources that Europe can call on to face the challenges that were clearly spelt out by Mr Prodi .
Whenever there is a concert - I had the opportunity in Brussels , during the Convention , of hearing the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra - the conductor of the orchestra asks for applause for the musicians .
governments , armed forces and non-state players need to be made more aware of their obligations under international humanitarian law .
it is currently a political event .
I promise that I will inform Parliament , maybe through its committees , of the development of this type of initiatives right from the start .
during the discussion in our Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , a number of important points were added .
the future free trade agreement with Korea should be up-to-date and include restrictive environmental and social requirements such as those in the fundamental ILO conventions , which aim to promote proper working conditions .
these minimum requirements should make it possible to improve air safety by increasing the quality standard with which staff must comply .
following internal EU discussions , the Commission then held exploratory talks with Russia , which have now resulted in broad consensus on a general approach .
the first is that the report takes an approach to the subject of industrial development that does not break down industrial and business interests into market sectors , but puts them together according to common objectives .
this does not increase safety and is costly in terms of time and money ; incidentally it is completely unnecessary because the authorities already examine these data .
this is without doubt the core of reform .
if we go into which report is the general report , it will all become extremely complicated .
I will simply pocket the suggestion and pass it on .
Mr President , if a good policy consists of producing complete and correct diagnoses and drawing up and implementing the corresponding solutions , there is no doubt that the Commissions &apos; energy policy , promoted by Commissioner de Palacio , is an example of a good policy .
climate change is making the Arctic more accessible to human activities now , such as exploitation of natural resources and increased shipping , but the Arctic also has an important role to play as an early-warning sign for potentially catastrophic global climate change .
we think it would be difficult , if not impossible , to promote 15 countries of such diversity in one and the same campaign .
– With this last speech the debate on this report is closed .
I consider it essential to approve the conclusion of this visa waiver agreement , so that all EU citizens , including those of Estonia , Latvia , Malta and Cyprus , can travel without a visa to Brazil for purposes of tourism and business , in the same way in which citizens of Brazil can already travel visa-free to all EU Member States .
how do you aim to incorporate the idea of environmental education , not included in the priorities for the &apos; Spanish Presidency programme : more Europe &apos; , in your proposals ?
this brings me to Amendment No 3 , which has been adopted by the Committee on Economic Affairs and argues that the phased adoption of the various elements of the package should not be used as a tool by Member States to delay its implementation .
it is about high-earners and the well-educated , not about those with the greatest need .
citizens of Ireland , you are the only ones who have been given the opportunity to halt this dangerous development .
concerning safe building standards , these standards exist but the question is how closely these standards are followed in Member States .
this is why I will vote against all the other reports and abstain on the Haglund report .
what we advocate is a healthy balance between security and personal freedom .
. Mr President , the Commissioner spoke of the need for reform , and I agree with her ; the common market organisation for sugar has itself been corrupted by the sugar industry , which was geared to consumption plus privileged access for sugar from the ACP countries .
it is therefore absolutely necessary with regard to the maintenance of cultural and scenic diversity and to the strengthening of farming jobs in the Alps , to set up in this region their own target area .
however , the report is also right to ask that , as in research , where the EU can play a useful role in decommissioning , its work should as a matter of course include the many Central and Eastern European nations whose communist-built nuclear plants need help to decommission safely .
this is one of the most important issues to be dealt with by Parliament in the last few years .
you will thus be listed in the minutes as the speaker for your group .
I regard that as unacceptable .
we must make it even easier to deal with cross-border complaints relating to similar matters in the future .
( SL ) Madam President , we Europeans are living with an interesting paradox .
the Treaty also offers the Union the possibility to promote the fight against climate changes at an international level and guarantees adequate social protection to all its citizens .
it cannot be stressed often enough that the problem of drugs is also a problem of development .
no one is left out ; there are clear references to women , for example .
more specifically , I would like to thank Mr Schwaiger for the great effort he has made to publish what is , in our view , a very balanced report which clearly shows that he has an understanding of the situation on the ground .
this does not alter the fact that one day we will need the intervention of a European authority .
the interest expressed by the Members present here who are particularly close to the Baltic region , in particular those of Sweden and Denmark , show that the region is not forgotten by the Union .
I turn now to the aspect of external borders – points 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 , etc . – and cooperation amongst Member States .
everyone can imagine what happens if you decide to produce more regionally , for example in the agriculture sector .
now , why should that be ?
why ?
I welcome the fact that Parliament insisted in negotiations that social services , and particularly health and education , be prioritised by the Commission when drawing up CSPs .
let us consider AIDS , a scourge which has already claimed 25 million victims , let us remember the 14 000 people throughout the world who contract the HIV virus every day .
the programme will now finally acquire a legal basis and actually get under way .
we know that the European Union has some very ambitious ideas on this subject , and we will try to canvass support for them and try to make them globally accepted .
human rights and the process of democratisation were the most important .
Mr Casini has been very wise , as he often is on these matters , in that there are amendments which have absolutely nothing to do with Lisbon , and it is very clear they have nothing to do with Lisbon .
irrespective of whether or not there is at present any legal requirement for them to do so , the Court must prepare its own binding rules in this area .
we need to remedy this situation now and not wait until the year 2000 .
not only that , but they imply a discrimination based on nationality .
I would like to mention just one of these discriminatory measures , which affects traditional national minorities .
a bomb of money which is not being spent .
the creation of this temporary committee , which we welcome , is therefore the outcome of a long and persistent process of negotiation .
subject : illegal immigration to the EU from Morocco
Reconstruction aid to Kosovo is essential but the pile-up of earlier unspent budget lines means that more discussion might be fruitful .
in writing . - ( FI ) My thanks go to the rapporteur for an excellent , comprehensive report .
in other words , Parliament is a key player in this .
only in this way will we come closer to the economic and social cohesion which , together with political union , is the great objective of the European institutions and citizens .
Mr President , this is something which cannot wait .
ladies and gentlemen , our work is not yet complete , neither at home nor in the candidate countries .
yet the Labour government in the UK has not taken advantage of this excellent scheme .
it shows us a course that will not under any circumstances be that of increasing military action , which is something we should make every effort to resist .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
one such point is the question of human rights abusers who have been elected to parliament , because this is something that concerns us all .
I am also pleased that , in the course of enlargement , many forces have been deployed in monitoring the human rights situations in the candidate countries , and I think that this is one of those areas in which we cannot allow ourselves to relax , either now or after 1 May .
I welcome the fact that he has given a commitment that he will hold elections , but the international community must not allow him to turn his back on this commitment .
this is an essential condition for real equality and ending violence .
it is precisely this neoliberal strategy which supports and promotes unequal and one-sided development , the exploitation of the workers , the recycling of the unemployed and , ultimately , the disintegration of the trade union movement .
the countries in the region which were already poor are now poorer still , the living conditions of their people have deteriorated and the bombs certainly did not put an end to the chauvinism at which they were targeted .
this unanimity is based on the Geneva Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights .
it will not be one big project but I believe there will be elements that could ultimately fit our objectives : clean energy for the countries involved and additional exports to the European Union .
I should like to see the European Social Charter become part of the acquis communautaire , as well as the existence of effective mechanisms for following up on this .
we must therefore support all the measures designed to boost small and medium-sized enterprises .
I would like to thank everybody who has participated in the referendum process with such commitment , in particular all the Members of this Parliament who have contributed with their voices and opinions to achieving this significant result .
the second supplementary question is by Mr Fatuzzo .
that programme had positive results , and so the Group of the European People &apos;s Party welcomes the fact that the programme has been extended .
. I am taking over this question on behalf of my colleague , Mr Mandelson .
( RO ) Madam President , in 2006 , low-cost companies opened 225 new European airways routes , meaning 1 800 new flights per week .
and so I and my pensioner friends call upon Commissioner Diamantopoulou to put on a doctor &apos;s white coat , to treat the European Union &apos;s poorly medical service and to make us better .
the report by Hans-Peter Martin on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency for the financial year 2006 ( C6-0382 / 2007 - ,
in writing . - ( RO ) The liberalization of the telecommunications market , which has been carried out by the EU for 10 years , is an undisputed success .
what we are interested in is being able to offer ecologically as well as economically acceptable ways of obtaining sustainable energy to meet people &apos;s needs .
at the same time I am forced to conclude that the energy policy pursued by the EU , or to be more precise the research policy pursued by the EU , unfortunately does not emphasise renewable sources of energy in the same way as the Scapagnini report for example .
that is why we need to have fundamental talks on the current form and substance of the Union and on the role of the European Parliament .
the facts from Austria , Finland and Sweden show that it is possible to step up the use of renewable energy sources ; renewable energy sources account for between 20 and 25 % of energy consumption in these countries .
that , I think , is the message of this dossier : let us move on .
today , however , with these two texts , the European Union is sanctioning the need and importance of an active legal economic immigration policy .
after all , if they were approved and if then the Commission &apos;s draft were rejected , the situation of women would not be improved .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , wanting a knowledge economy is a good thing , but it is not enough .
the suggestion to delete the 0.2 % tolerance for the fat contents seems to be acceptable .
in writing . - ( RO ) The Danube &apos;s job is to provide the backbone for a macro-regional structure which features Länder , regions and Member States , along with countries which do not belong yet or at all to the EU , all in search of common prosperity .
this is the first time that such a large-scale initiative has been launched at Community level in the field of sport , particularly one focusing on its educational value .
I was very pleased and interested to hear , Mrs Ferrero-Waldner , that the Commission also supports this position , which is most welcome .
however , the situation is changing rapidly and substantially , because women today are part of the armed forces and are present in the peacekeeping forces ; they are also present on the side of those who commit violence , as stated in the report .
I would ask you to respond to Parliament &apos;s demands on this matter .
Title III is dedicated to control measures .
this is the wrong approach .
we want to prevent Nigeria from adopting this law on the pretext of protection against AIDS .
for us , it was exclusively legal considerations that mattered .
thank you , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf .
we almost feel sorry for the rapporteur , who tries to introduce a little order into what he himself terms &apos; chaos &apos; , in other words the jumble of contradictory or inapplicable rules , regulations and directives resulting from the horse-trading that has taken place between Member States throughout what we incorrectly call European integration .
we will all agree that a combination of short maternity leaves , taken immediately after a child is born , followed by part-time work and high quality child care facilities is the most effective mix possible .
I believe that is the most important issue which should be dealt with at the European Union / Latin American Summit of Heads of State .
the results relating to the Member States &apos; performance should clearly improve this spring .
I agree with Mr Czarnecki that liberalism has spread across the world .
criminal acts were committed , and that is why the state was obliged to intervene .
I share the rapporteur &apos;s opinions , observations and satisfaction concerning such issues as the deeper involvement of members of the Assembly in its work , the quality of debates and the more relevant nature of these debates .
I have also noted progress in the implementation of the principle of &apos; accessing funding for SMEs &apos; .
however , the Commission will know that we are increasingly calling for greater accountability .
but with the inspectors due to report again on 14 February , there is little time left to him before the court of the international community has to reach a verdict .
rather , this Europe is a community of values designed to defend and promote the achievements in terms of civilisation which we in Europe have fought for over recent centuries .
I expect the same courtesy from you .
so what can be done ?
we believe that unemployment should be tackled locally , regionally or nationally , since there are many different reasons why people lose their jobs .
I call on the Council and the Commission to really take this review seriously , then , rather than regarding it as a bit of a joke .
personally , I would want the resources already in place to be used for this , and I would be pleased if that were the case .
in the light of recent events , we request a detailed report on this point and we call upon Europe to play a useful part and to demand from both Israel and Mr Arafat a genuine peace process , not just the words or terrorist bombs of recent years and months .
I am optimistic for the future .
it would be a sign of honesty if this were presented along with political conclusions .
I wager it would not .
certain very high-profile cases have arisen recently - the latest being that of ECHO - and these show how necessary it is to put one &apos;s own house in order , at least in terms of rules and priorities , before giving lessons to others .
I would ask that , when it comes to tomorrow &apos;s vote on the amendment - which does not concern an increase in the overall quota , but instead a balancing-out - you tell the people you have dealing with it not how it will not work but how it will work , and thus take a rather more positive approach .
the debate is closed .
the fact that we are suspending the agreement procedures does not mean that we want to isolate Belarus .
our actions here are not simply about the past ; they are about drawing the right conclusions from the events and doing everything in our power to combat today &apos;s forms of slavery , sexual exploitation and human trafficking .
in any case , I feel - and I want to believe - that history will prove these reservists right .
but this is not the aim of the report , which advocates financing research and development into e-cinema , fitting cinemas with expensive equipment , recommending that we let the market take care of the rest .
the projects included in Annex III , I would insist , are based on economic studies and political approval from both the Van Miert group and the Council .
the EU is India &apos;s largest trade partner , with trade in goods and services worth approximately EUR 84 billion in 2009-2010 .
( for the outcome and other details of the vote : see Minutes )
in fact , there are fundamental democratic issues and also , above all , problems resulting from the economic and social situation .
I chose to abstain on this report and on the proposed amendment on fiscal convergence .
but the single currency is not the only instrument available to us for completing the single market and exploiting its full potential .
the fuel quality directive has two objectives : air quality and a reduction in CO2 emissions .
how many people who suffer from mysterious numbness and sensations in their hands and legs , etcetera , have been poisoned by Acryl amide ?
it is fair to acknowledge that some countries have made considerable efforts in the past , which have led to undeniable improvements in energy efficiency , and these achievements must be recognised when it comes to deciding on the objectives to be fulfilled .
the European Parliament has clearly reduced the rates of compensation in the airlines ’ favour .
if this Presidency can report that the Council approves the Statute , it can consider itself a success .
finally , there has been much talk about the names of people to fill the functions of President and High Representative .
when we know how the meat comes to be contaminated , its elimination will be easy and restored confidence in the markets will be nothing less than overwhelming .
the waves , of course , continued to lap at their feet and the King had proved his point .
the consultation that resulted in the proposal and the work within the Council have shown that there was hardly any support for extending the scope of the directive to unfair business-to-business commercial practices .
although it was a big improvement , some articles raised doubts – Article 301 , first and foremost .
it is up to the guilty to pay and up to Europe to implement a strong industrial policy that meets the needs of the populations before dividends are allowed to be distributed !
