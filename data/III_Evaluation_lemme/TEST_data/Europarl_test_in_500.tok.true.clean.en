if it is legally impossible to take a step backwards , and if we must submit to this for reasons that are not entirely reasonable , Madam President , I would at least like to see Mrs Klaß &apos;s suggestions followed .
the EU , like the USA , supports and will continue to support Ukraine &apos;s aim to become a WTO Member and is striving to accelerate the country &apos;s admission to this organisation .
we think it is in the general interest to trust the good faith of the European Commission that it will implement our resolution of 19 September .
that longer life span , extending well beyond the age of 65 , represents a considerable achievement as regards culture , society , health and economics .
( Applause )
- Before the vote :
we must therefore be more vigorous in defending democracy in Albania .
the first is strong enough action .
I will end by saying just one thing : what the Commission has never done in relation to this initiative has been to throw in the towel .
the Palestinians have a right to Palestinian land and to a Palestinian state .
I add my welcome and my best wishes to the Irish presidency .
the report calls for an increase in &quot; the efficiency and competitiveness of the private sector &quot; on world markets .
we should address the practical aspects of counter-terrorism and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
it should be noted that financing of such major projects in developing countries represents several times the combined annual funding of all multilateral development banks .
as such , therefore , they were able to obtain more than 60 % of the technical assistance appropriations .
Mr President , a short while ago we were both relieved and proud when Kofi Annan returned from Baghdad after having managed to reach an agreement , although we all knew in the back of our minds that this agreement could prove short-lived .
what statements are you referring to , Mr Wijsenbeek ?
but particularly in the ECB &apos; s case , as it does not have the track record of the mighty Bundesbank and could quickly lose the confidence of the financial markets if it is reluctant to protect itself through greater transparency .
many of these things have not been implemented .
war destroys and , as Mr van den Berg has said , we shall therefore have to build an international framework for reconstruction .
Finland earned special praise for the excellent facilities in its universities and colleges , particularly computers and libraries , as well as for the study guidance provided and student halls of residence .
can I thank the honourable Member for the supplementary question .
however , this has been the case to a lesser extent in Central and Eastern Europe .
let us take the example of Caesareans .
seriously , however , did we think , in the common foreign and security policy or in the various negotiations that have taken place , that it was up to the UfM to deal with these issues ?
furthermore , no right is being removed from those already enjoyed by the citizens of the Member States , and nor is any higher protection being diluted into a Charter that lays down only minimum rules .
cases of repression of the Christian minority are becoming increasingly worrying .
its practicality and durability depend on the design , the method of manufacture and the materials used .
these are strong sanctions which can be requested by the Commission and which have been implemented .
I began by expressing the EU &apos;s lack of confidence in the courts and of the judgments that are given and , if Mr Carnero González wishes me to , I should also be happy to express a lack of confidence , on behalf of the EU , in the way in which prisoners and people charged with offences are treated in Equatorial Guinea .
the EU should impress upon Turkey that it is bound to carry out the pledges it made concerning democracy , human rights , freedom of expression and the release of political prisoners , in response to the requirements set by the EU in connection with the approval of the customs union with Turkey .
it is my opinion that , here too , the delays suggest that the problem is an underlying one , concerning the overall mechanism and perhaps what has , over the past few years , become the modern notion of programming in Italy .
the Hungarian Presidency of the European Council played a very important part in this process .
for some of our group , this was a pragmatic step ; for others it actually meant another step in the direction of Turkey &apos;s membership , something about which they are still quite pessimistic .
this example shows that the financing of large-scale research projects is dependent on recoveries from other areas , the amount of which is difficult to determine in advance .
there is no doubt that in the medium term , the rules of the international money markets will have to be tightened because of this crisis .
some of this work I saw for myself just last week in my own region .
for example , it did not propose the essential change to the legal basis in order to refer to the new text of the Treaties that I have just mentioned , but it was certainly a good starting point for our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to work on .
there is at present an enormous tax burden when businesses are handed on from one generation to the next .
this will entail , for example , additional research and a focus on the protection of our ecosystems , including restricting the use of pesticides .
this is obviously an important issue that Mr Sacrédeus is addressing , and one affecting our values .
I believe that we need to have greater ambition in terms of police coordination , in other words , Europol ; judicial coordination , in other words , Eurojust ; the European public prosecutor ; the technical standardisation of criminal investigations ; unifying criminal trial law ; and in terms of bringing the respective criminal legal systems closer together .
at that meeting the Council reiterated its grave concern at Iran ’ s resumption of activities at the uranium conversion facility at Isfahan and urged Iran to implement all the measures requested by the International Atomic Energy Agency Board .
Broadly speaking , we can welcome it as evidenced by the fact that we have not tabled any amendments .
VAT , which this text also supports , is one of the aberrations of this system .
we must support Ukraine and enable it to build up its infrastructure in such a way that it can do away with these dangerous Russian reactors altogether .
in this context , this response needs to be made in the political , economic and development spheres , and Mr Danjean reminded us of the huge resources in the European Development Fund .
the delay in launching the Nabucco project has been due , unfortunately , to the individual interests of certain Member States .
in my opinion we are also risking the health of the people of the European Union because this poultry meat imported into the European Union does not meet the same high standards that we expect here .
we have to lay the foundations for shared management of migratory flows by adopting a generous and united approach to the issue of the movement of persons in the Mediterranean area .
when the investigation is complete , we will make the appropriate decisions at that time and pursue it further if it is deemed necessary to do so at that particular stage .
these countries also fail to fulfil international obligations in the area of nuclear safety .
cultural industries in Europe (
as you know , Rule 2 states that Members of the European Parliament shall exercise their mandate independently , they shall not be bound by any instructions and shall not receive a binding mandate .
I am fully aware how carefully the term &apos; historic &apos; ought to be used .
however , I should like to emphasise that our common objective , to safeguard public security , is self-evident .
the rule of law is extremely uneven in Pakistan .
the report by Mr Casaca offers ample basis for this .
we hope that this Parliament is up to the job and does not disappoint our fellow citizens ...
we are closely monitoring developments in Guinea-Bissau and are aware of the tremendous difficulties faced by the civilian population .
I would like to clarify just one point , which is clear to the Commissioner but which I believe must be clear to this Parliament . it is not the case that our concern about nuclear safety is really a hidden instrument to prevent expansion .
I am inclined to say that &apos; where there is no formal equality , there is no real equality either &apos; .
let me be equally clear , we are also deeply concerned by the killing of Israeli civilians by Palestinians and by the recent executions of Palestinians .
this document seems to represent a good foundation on which the Commission can build in order to establish the legal tool needed to effectively implement the global strategy .
secondly , I call for certain standards in the keeping and production of broiler chickens and other agricultural products to be demanded in future WTO negotiations .
the results can now be seen in a contaminated external environment and workers who have suffered injury to their nervous systems .
why these two groups ?
a weakness in the report is the strict requirement for applicant countries to adapt to a capitalist or new liberal society .
we believe that a non-linear increase in national quotas is vital so that additional increases can be given to Member States where production quotas have traditionally been insufficient .
our AMR , co-signed by S &amp; D and aimed at giving the resolution a stronger regulatory flavour , was rejected .
that being so , there can be only one peace process – one that is based on negotiations .
Thirdly , we must use all means possible to strengthen the united Belarusian opposition .
in the 1940s Bangladesh was divided into two sections on the basis of religion , which failed to ease an already complicated situation .
the macroeconomic dialogue is part of the European Employment Pact .
however , the Commission is not making use of this opportunity and is relying on a rescue package involving outdated concepts such as road building and the car industry .
my thanks also go to the rapporteur and members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
flexibility has been mentioned here .
I should like to congratulate Mr Schmid on his fine report .
I believe that the European Union has made a significant contribution to bringing this about . the European Parliament especially has taken decisions to strengthen equal rights and equal opportunities legislation on behalf of the women who live in our Member States .
those young people who demonstrated entirely peacefully at the time are now prematurely aged , ground down as a result of the terrible conditions prevailing in Chinese prisons .
Firstly there is the appointment of the new Commission .
then I am sure we will be glad to sign and also to implement a cooperation agreement with the democratic forces in Belarus , as we are trying to do with the other reform states .
unfortunately , the impression is sometimes given that information is requested and delivered by telegram , and it therefore needs to flow better .
Naturally , this would require positive developments as regards democracy , human rights and the principles of the rule of law .
GATT settles such questions on the basis of the SPS , the sanitary and phyto-sanitary code , which is a scientific code .
I agree with the thesis of Mr Goebbels &apos; s report .
the debate is closed .
it is normal practice , as Members of this House will recognize , for Council presidencies to mount an exhibition of a cultural , social or historical nature in the conference part of the Justus Lipsius building .
above all , this category includes environmental measures of relevance to agricultural policy and this makes it highly significant in terms of sustainable agricultural development .
in reality , it is not only the economic aspect that plays an important part - and in that respect Kazakhstan has a great future ahead of it - but the political aspect is also very important .
that strikes me as crucial .
they will not deter investors if they set an extremely tough requirement for the immediate reintegration of renewable energies .
once the treaty has been ratified we shall be able to focus on those policy areas where people want Europe to do more .
this gives rise to increasing barriers to the free movement between Member States of products and services that serve as support for such advertising and sponsorship .
a good and clear result has finally been achieved .
people &apos;s health should not be trifled with .
the Internet is the most global , open and fast-moving market environment , where music , films , books and software circulate .
( DE ) Madam President , in this House , neither the lift system nor the bell is working .
you mention them in the strategic objectives on page four , Mr President .
debt relief can be a useful tool in that quest , but it can by no means offer a really full response .
Mr President , many Eurosceptics claim that the democratic progress embodied in this treaty is slight and that , in fact , it is a fig leaf for a dark and more sinister Europe hidden behind it .
then we would not be worrying about the good deals others might make if we ban this production in our countries , but rather about our own consistency and sense of justice !
even in such an apparently technical area as competition policy we need to bring the message to the consumers .
Firstly at European level in order to ultimately put an end to the special conditions which allowed the cover of certain types of risk by the public sector , but also by means of the International Civil Aviation Organisation , which is where we believe this type of issue should essentially be dealt with .
( the President cut off the speaker . )
those arguments , and others , lead us to oppose the Sindal report .
I believe , in fact , that the fund is a valuable tool for enabling the European Union to show solidarity with the populations of regions affected by natural disasters , by providing financial support to help ensure a swift return to normal living conditions .
once adopted , it will complete and make more coherent the acquis communautaire in the field of employee involvement and make a decisive contribution to building the social dimension of the internal market .
the order of business was adopted thus amended
for us , the question is how we can keep elderly people in the job market and what that requires of the labour market in general .
the question therefore remains : what has the President , as a human being , done for this House ?
what have we achieved ?
the legislation should show what the Member States have actually agreed upon .
the candidate countries would have to accept this code as part of the acquis communautaire before their accession and would then have to put it into practice .
the existing infrastructure , as well as the response of the national authorities was nevertheless overwhelmed by the force of the natural phenomenon .
today , we have the technology to ensure that this identity corresponds to the product &apos;s actual history , what materials have been used to produce it and how it has been produced .
but I can assure you that the only solution is to form an interinstitutional partnership and work very closely with the Member States .
now we have reached a satisfactory rate in terms of payment .
finally , I wish to take this opportunity to highlight the plight of Bulgarian nurses incarcerated in Libya and now under threat of the death penalty .
Mr President , the European Constitution is dead .
the previous protocol , which has now been extended , is the eighth in the series since the two parties signed the fisheries agreement in 1983 .
we need to give coming generations a society in which colour , creed , sex , origin or sexual preferences are not reasons for discriminatory treatment .
I have to confess that I am not entirely a fan of voluntary codes .
on the scale of fundamental values , liberty is at the heart of any ethical debate .
Mr President , last week the Bureau of the European Parliament approved Parliament &apos;s rules on openness .
it concerns one specific part of the support plan that was decided and announced on 2 August but has not yet been put into effect : state participation in Alstom &apos;s capital .
a method of alignment has been designed regarding the proposal for regulation , aimed at the exemption of certain categories of horizontal aid from needing to be notified to the Commission .
measures , in other words , capable of promoting a common European response , in order to better address the macro-economic imbalances between Member States and to ensure their sustainable growth .
that may mean a significant flow from meat and dairy to calves and is far more attractive than killing calves at a young age .
then in article 30 , paragraph 2 , which states that a person may resubmit a request for admission no more than two years after expulsion .
let me start with the regulation on rest and driving times .
I continue to focus on better relations with the developing countries in connection with the preparations for the Fifth Conference of the Parties , not least by prioritising the practical formulation of the mechanism for sustainable development , the Clean Development Mechanism .
however , we are also entitled to fairness .
once these measures have been implemented , consumers will have more control when purchasing goods .
we will therefore support his report .
this report has been prepared .
it is not a valid approach to only look at the countries , but also at the regions .
I would simply like to say one thing : in our country , we are seeing a rise in extremism , and this is doubtless because one part of the political class considers mandates and posts to be at its disposal .
in the second instance , in a rare case of hasty cooperation between governments at European level , an agreement riddled with holes was signed with the USA , known as the transfer of Passenger Name Records or PNR , not only without adequate proof of the need for the measures , but also with barely any fundamental safeguarding of binding American obligations for the secure and legal use of our data .
my second brief question is this : if these questions demonstrate that the fruit and vegetables COM and the CAP reforms of 1992 are not properly functioning , perhaps these events should actually lead to a proper reform of the fruit and vegetables COMs and the common agricultural policy ?
we have discussed this issue a great deal in recent weeks .
this all remains a mystery .
unfortunately , we have extensive evidence to the contrary , evidence that reveals radical malfunctions among the European institutions .
on behalf of the PSE . - ( RO ) The Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions requires land , rail or waterborne freight carriers operating within the Community to provide information on their rates , applicable agreements , terms of carriage , as well as the necessary documentation .
it showed that it is an operating policy .
we want to protect the environment .
Double gearing is , therefore , a view of finance independent of the value of the investment .
I should also like to know from the Council - as I used to be rapporteur - whether the Council is happy to accept a fresh proposal to address environmental crime , for that is the most important question on the agenda here .
then we shall take the vote on this motion .
this is a first reaction report on the Agenda 2000 communication and , notwithstanding the importance of enlargement , it considers many other aspects as well .
in the field of research too , as Mr Hendrick rightly said , we must set ourselves new targets .
I will mention five .
but I would be very cautious about the word &apos; reform &apos; in an EU context .
who knows ?
this is why we are proposing to study the appointment of a European Union ombudsman for financial services provided in the retail markets , independent of any Community or national institution and of any particular interests .
the Institute and , later , the Bank , must guarantee conditions of stability and solvency , with low levels of inflation and interest rates , offering a credible framework that is both secure and solvent internationally .
the checks carried out by the European Commission do not ensure adequate scrutiny of EU spending .
I think we need to find a stable , long-term solution to make up for the damage they have suffered from the expansion and opening-up of the markets .
it would not be reasonable to reduce the funding for research and transport in order to find money for Galileo , as is being proposed by the EU Finance Ministers .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m .
do we want to have families that are adapted to the market and the needs of companies or a market and companies that are adapted to families ?
in this light any attempt to use this issue to create controversy within the WTO overlooks our honourable efforts and jeopardizes the steady progress on international trade and the environment which we all hope for and which would almost certainly lead to self-inflicted defeat and loss of credibility of the EU within the multilateral disputes settlement procedures , if we follow another route .
above all we have a few tens of millions of people out of work in Europe , and that is more than enough .
well done , President-in-Office - and friend , if I can say that - because that leads me to my third and last message .
I also welcome the proposal to establish a Euro-Mediterranean Energy Community within the framework of a policy aimed at implementing large-scale projects in the fields of renewable energy and energy infrastructure .
it is just a description of the problems .
it has failed to protect public health and the environment .
in northern countries we have to cope with huge forest areas with a single registration number , so that the new regulation holds no problem whatsoever in store for these areas .
in actual fact , I am rather against them .
( Applause )
Europe is at a crossroads .
the Commission has been considering the possibility of such backing for eight months already , and this cannot go on .
I am delighted President Prodi is holding a seminar on anti-Semitism next week , but why has the Council failed to agree the framework decision on making racial harassment and racial attacks criminal offences ?
I would like to start with a more general comment .
no single nation , no matter how strong or how wealthy , how organised or how capable , can meet this threat alone .
Consequently we must question the Council &apos;s sincerity in seeking to address what is a major area of concern throughout the European Union .
if fine words have led the citizens to believe that the Union was attentive to their demands , their requirements and their needs , the vote today has proved the contrary .
as there seems to be a broad consensus on this issue , I hope that there will also be agreement when it comes to the vote tomorrow and that we can support the Commission .
the Baltic is not far from being a mare nostrum within the European Union .
I would even like to say this : I do not think that we can boycott a quarter of humanity .
many European countries have put in place various types of restrictions and deliberate obstacles that inhibit competition , hold back the development of the common market , prevent prices from falling and contribute to a reduction in the quality of labour .
let me assure you that Korea will continue to step up its cooperation with the EU .
I would like to stress again that it was not the intention of the Commission to effect a major overhaul of the Seveso II Directive .
that means that data protection must be guaranteed in every respect , the deletion of data after a certain , reasonable period must be guaranteed and appeal facilities must be precisely set out for citizens in the event of the violation of their fundamental rights .
in writing . - ( SV ) Madam President , It is rare for a committed eurosceptic like me to be able to commend a proposal and recommend that the House votes in favour .
however , I cannot help but think that the sincerity of our comments on solidarity will be a little bit tempered by the action of some of our Member States .
Nine years ago , Nigeria took a step towards democracy and came back to civilian rule , even though all elections since then have been widely criticised for irregularities , fraud and violence .
there was all-round pessimism regarding the possibilities of the draft European Union Constitution being accepted during the Irish Presidency .
in the third place , motherhood is indelibly related to the demographic problems of each country and it is generally known that this is a grave problem .
there are other important points , particularly on the macroeconomic side . I believe that all Member States need to be subject to common surveillance .
the economic and monetary union means a new beginning for Europe , both in terms of entrepreneurship and of economic policy .
I regret that the proposal for intensive cooperation with non-EU Member States in suppressing the movement of drugs and the trade in drugs has not been included in the final report , despite the fact that it is precisely from these numerous non-Member States that the greatest volume of drugs flows into Europe .
increasingly fat , increasingly rich , bent on a trade war without quarter .
the aims of this legislative package , with these two directives on transfer and procurement that we are discussing here today , will ensure that it is not just a matter of competitiveness , but also of putting a stop to the wasting of taxpayers &apos; money on the production of defence equipment and of preventing corruption .
Mr President , no law-abiding citizen should be worried about his or her identity or their children &apos;s identity being substantiated .
I should like to finish off with an observation for the Council , which is once again conspicuous by its absence .
because crimes against humanity cannot be forgotten , and we here must be certain that no war criminal will remain unpunished .
we have to look at why they are fleeing from their own countries .
the work of the CTE has helped to clarify the issues and close the gap .
in acknowledging the crucial role of statistics in the development of more effective tourism policies at European , national , regional and local level , I believe that the overall objective should be to strengthen the EU tourism sector through action coordinated at Union level to complement the efforts of individual Member States
in this context , we must remember what happened at the cemetery in Strasbourg .
on the issue of whether the decision to provide direct financial assistance was right or wrong , we can adopt various positions .
to think that what happened in Gaza with Hamas was an accident is to misread , even with the gift of hindsight , our own failures in the European Union and in the US to deal properly with the solutions that may be required .
we cannot go on like this .
we also believe that intellectual property rights are essential for encouraging creativity and innovation .
I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the Commission is currently studying ways of implementing the preparatory activities of the NGO support programme in the new Member States , in the areas of respect for the law , democracy and fundamental rights , in line with Parliament &apos;s wishes .
first of all , a number of quasi-constitutional texts guarantee these rights in the European Union and are referred to systematically in the Commission &apos; s proposals .
the revival of the Lisbon strategy &apos;s growth and employment objectives is an important aspect of this renewed legislative framework as too much delay has already been taken on the aim of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive knowledge based economy .
I expect that the competent authorities in all the Member States , which are parties to the Espoo Convention , will perform their duties and assume their responsibilities as they ought to .
this report shows us that we can progress along this road to a democratic European Union in a crucial area , if the proposals it makes are implemented .
for her pains , Mrs Andreasen was dismissed from her job .
we question it because the consolidation policy of banking institutions has continued , on many occasions creating idols with feet of clay without taking into account the real system that exists in our countries , and the reason why consumer credit has been uncontrolled , leading to huge debts being amassed both by individuals and , as a knock-on effect , banks .
this , however , is precisely the philosophy that Lisbon refutes , which is why it emphasises the rest .
I should like to point out to my fellow Members that , for as long as Greece is in economic crisis , no government will agree to start negotiations in the Council and the proof of Greece &apos;s good faith was demonstrated when it agreed to this country &apos;s candidature .
we all know what a dark day it was for the whole of mankind when the Turkish military and police forces brutally invaded the prisons .
the Commission is convinced that the same should apply here .
do not do it again .
Mr President , there are reasons to feel deeply concerned about the physical and mental health of the detained journalists , the priest and the four Laotian citizens .
they are also among those that have been implementing strong adjustment programmes with the support of the International Monetary Fund and those that have requested financial support from the EU .
we also need to pay more attention to the way we draft legislation , and this means that we must have good and sufficient technical facilities .
Mr President , I would also like to say thank you for a very interesting and rewarding debate on the third pillar and what has taken place during the past year .
I think however that we should do all we can now to make sure that future elections are held in more democratic conditions .
I thank all of you once again .
I regard it , in fact , as a hand outstretched in cooperation and I see it as a manifestation of the fact that people have been listening .
report ( A5-0031 / 2001 ) by Mr Bakopoulos , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on
credible civil crisis management and prevention are only possible if all sides are aware of the military capabilities .
Surely , given the particular nature of this report and the need to make the Centre as effective as possible , we should also be allowed to change the procedure ?
I am not defending them because , as highlighted in the Metten report , asymmetric crises in the past affected , above all , the United Kingdom in 1980 , Germany following reunification , and the Netherlands .
moreover , by means of a budgetary contortion , not to say an artless ruse , this amount is being transferred to category 4 - and I should like to see just how we spend this ECU 100 m and what we spend it on .
the 77 % of Spaniards who said ‘ yes ’ to this constitution have the same value as the 55 % of French people who said ‘ no ’ to it .
however , it is important that we retain a sense of proportion about this matter .
thank you for those clear answers , Commissioner .
Hundreds of businesses were seriously affected by the floods , their plant and buildings badly damaged or wrecked .
as will have become apparent from the debate in Parliament , there is too much bureaucracy and there are too many regulations . what we lack is training , better access to capital and a long list of structural changes to enable us to cope successfully in the new knowledge-based economy .
like the rapporteur I have my doubts about the actual implementation of the protocol .
so , some room needs to be made under the heading &apos; negative aspects of ACTA &apos; to assess the fundamental rights aspect that ACTA still has in the current draft and that the Commission from now on is legally obliged to mainstream .
the Commission coordinated this exercise , and provided the results of the first phase of the investigation in November 2007 .
several amendments also help clarify the text , and , furthermore , we accept Amendments Nos 4 , 7 , 8 , 14 , 27 , 28 and 29 .
the three successive postponements of the vote in Parliament were motivated by a commitment to global public health .
in my view , there are , first of all , excellent methodological reasons for adopting the report .
above all , they should be targeted more effectively .
now , when the crash comes , it is worsened by the inability to devalue .
these targets can only be reached if we are forward-looking in our energy policy , too , and so a comprehensive energy Action Plan was adopted in Brussels along with the climate targets .
Thirdly , we are told that progress is being made in the area of the third pillar .
a new media industry , however , requires a new approach .
I understand that ; that is the way of things in a social market economy .
Madam President , on a point of order .
on many occasions in Sweden I have also expressed a strong confidence in the Swedish labour market model which has been developed around our Swedish collective agreements .
we suggest that the VIS should be consulted in exceptional cases when there are doubts regarding identity .
it was a mistake to reject it .
the Commission wanted to include a framework for the structure of fundamental rights in its third report , specifically the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in December 2000 .
those involved in organising lifelong learning programmes and applying for funding under the associated financial instruments will undoubtedly welcome any reduction in the red tape associated with these procedures .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall use this opportunity to carry on where the previous speaker left off .
they only want to listen to those parts of civil society that fit into the federalist mould .
in this respect , I understand and appreciate the desire to emphasize training and education and to ensure that it is encouraged throughout life .
to sum up , we need the right amount of courage and a far-sighted policy that is up to the challenge that the process of enlargement sets all of us .
I also hope that everyone will be treated according to the same standards .
we therefore feel that this directive both increases responsibility and helps towards deregulation , which is something that the PPE Group welcomes .
Delaying the reconstruction effort would be equally irresponsible .
Commissioner Wallström mentioned codes of good administrative behaviour , and I would like to ask her and Mr Diamandouros whether it is not time , now that the new Commission is starting its work , to make a proposal for legislation that would apply to all the institutions and oblige them all to adhere to the principles of good governance .
I had experience of this in the Limousin with the DORSAL project .
the contribution of the Cohesion Fund to overcoming the crisis is considerable , particularly in the poorest regions .
there has been no change in that whatsoever .
for the Socialists , Mrs Gebhardt claims she turned the directive upside down , whilst for the Conservatives Mr Harbour rejoices that an excellent compromise has been reached .
( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , multilateral cooperation on fisheries in international waters is necessary to ensure their sustainability and the preservation of fish stocks in the medium and long term .
hence , the Commission &apos;s proposal to fund a recall mechanism using the vegetable producers organisations &apos; budget is unacceptable .
( FR ) Application of the regulatory procedure
Forecasts for growth have been revised downwards , as a result of the Asian crisis , the Russian crisis , the Latin American crisis and the fall in the value of the dollar , as the Commissioner has mentioned this very afternoon .
I wanted to express my satisfaction with this , and I hope that not only the Commission but also the governments of our Member States will follow this sound advice .
dangerous substances must not be allowed to be used in cosmetics .
it is a good feeling to see that Europe is taking a leading role in the third industrial revolution .
the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance is strongly in favour of the accession of all the Balkan countries , as well as Turkey .
Consequently , in line with the view expressed by the rapporteur , I would suggest that the outermost regions deserve to be treated as a special case in view of their specific constraints , under Article 299 ( 2 ) , regarding the conditions for access to the Structural Funds , whereby priority financial support should be given to them , irrespective of their income level .
we think that it would be in the common interest of both our institutions , and of our borrowers too , for us to move towards a more rational and functional division of labour .
ensure that the long-term budget that emerges from the negotiations with Parliament is characterised by higher priority being given to research and development .
one thing that is clear - and which the Commissioner tells us as do the Council of Ministers very regularly - is that there is severe over-capitalization of fishing fleets , not only in Europe but worldwide .
the European Council is pleased with the progress that Turkey has made towards meeting the political Copenhagen criterion .
Mountain regions in particular require further support .
that is certainly a practical way of applying the precautionary principle .
the already adopted Regulation on TSEs contains clear requirements that direct risk material be marked .
we know about the relationship between democracy and respect for human rights .
the aim of our visit is to bring European standards to the Ukrainian public .
its provisions concerning the inspection of documents and the hearing of witnesses need to be updated in the light of the greater emphasis on administrative openness and the need to gain the confidence of the public and promote a modern administrative culture at Community level .
Employees need flexibility to reconcile their professional lives and their personal lives , or to pursue their professional lives along new paths .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
I wonder if the Council of Ministers considers that the increased openness which is now hopefully to come within the EU ought also to embrace the Council of Ministers &apos; addresses to the European Court of Justice .
if we want to help democracy to become established there on a lasting basis and win over the people of the region - and here I definitely include the people of Yugoslavia - for the European model , we have to offer them a European prospect .
in the absence of such proof , this argument may amount to no more than a bluff .
indeed , the little progress that was made is a result of great pressure from important sectors in several Member States , of which the milk crisis is an example .
today I want to set out how work has been proceeding since then and how I see the way ahead now with the support of the European External Action Service .
however , I want to bring to the President &apos;s attention the fact that these arbitrary acts of the Cuban dictatorship must be reported and publicised to prevent them from being repeated .
Exactly one week ago , the Latvian company was forced into bankruptcy .
the drama of Serbia and Kosovo should caution us against taking hasty decisions .
we welcome that but it is not good enough that it is based on unanimity . it must be based on qualified majority voting and co-decision with this House .
I was interested in what the Commissioner outlined just now , in particular about using the Structural Funds , but I second what Mrs Grossetête and Mr Onesta said regarding their limits .
secondly , the EIB has been criticised for a lack of openness and of willingness to engage in dialogue with , for example , environmental movements in different countries .

in any event , everything requires full investigation .
in the view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , implementation of the Lamfalussy process is acceptable only if it operates in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement that we drew up during the previous Parliamentary term , which makes it possible to take full account of the position of the European Parliament to the same extent as the deliberations of the Council .
it is hoped that doing this will enable the trading scheme to start working .
however , you leave it to me to confirm that respect for minorities is truly part of the founding spirit of the Union , as is respect for cultural diversity , and multilingualism obviously represents an immediate aspect of that .
this will remain a key aspect of our engagement in Afghanistan , be it in the political support to women MPs in the new Afghan Parliament or through our support to women &apos;s participation in local development projects such as the widely-recognised National Solidarity Programme , which we have been funding through the World Bank since 2002 .
now , this directive is more about openness and the protection of minority shareholders , and less about takeover rules .
. Mr President , I wish to thank Members for their contributions .

during the dialogue process we sometimes try to suggest this kind of thing .
the amendments agreed would mean that audiovisual media service providers would have to register only after they begin offering their services , and that is in line with the directive .
in this respect , we therefore support the Kindermann report &apos;s advocacy of 800 cm2 , rather than the 450 cm2 which are the rule at present .
where the state has failed to provide education for poor children , parents themselves have come together , finance non-state education and , therefore , are also able to subsidise the non-working poor .
finally , I wish to say to the Commission that I understand what it is trying to do but , until the beef market has time to recover from the recent crisis , it is absolutely necessary to ease the very severe proposals so that farmers can stay in business .
however , the interesting debate on a possible future EU-wide tax on Arms Sales is still in its infancy , and there are many implications that need to be fully explored and discussed , as outlined by the Dutch Presidency in the debate yesterday .
so your remarks are welcome , but the Minutes show that yesterday , immediately after we learned of the award , I did address Parliament along those lines .
such fear can spread throughout Russia .
Firstly , I did not say that the data from Cyprus and Malta were worse than those from the other countries .

I find it amazing that colleagues in this House are so willing to espouse Soviet economics .
there is a need for a deep , comprehensive analysis and diagnosis of the situation of LDCs and concrete proposals for solutions aimed at improving the living conditions of the citizens of these countries in the short term , and at leaving the group in the long term .
on that score , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party is strongly in favour of not just Europol but also Eurodac being put in a strong position .
what is new in the document ?
that will take time , because this is also a question of societal change , but it is very important to be there and offer and agree to that .
my group calls on you to ensure that Parliament is fully involved in all of this and we expect you take seriously your promise to support small and medium-sized businesses and to improve environmental protection , the sustainable use of resources and food security .

building on these initial experiences , the directive already provides for a full review in 2006 .
the history of the past 25 years has amply demonstrated that Irish interests have been supported both fairly and generously by successive Commissions .
the second key word in the report is inequality , and several types of inequality at that .
it has not so far fulfilled its duties and must be penalised .
we will again report in detail on the results of these efforts .
however , we are a little disappointed and I ask you to pass this on to Mrs Reding and Mr Barroso .
the report is , nevertheless , quite critical of Member States &apos; failure to comply with the notification of catches , infringements and other information relating to the CFP .

in particular , I endorse the proposal that Europol should be given precisely defined operational and executive powers determining which national police bodies are to be responsible for all the measures carried out in their countries .
we need to implement the measures and therefore we have agreed with Russia to reduce the bottlenecks .
it notes the success of such programmes in Ireland , Spain , Portugal and Greece to relieve these inequalities and encourages similar strategies , frameworks and action programmes to generate progress in affected areas , especially in eastern Europe .

I believe our aid can only be a drop in the ocean , but it may serve a useful purpose inside the country , helping to overcome the barriers that exist there .
when I hear MEPs talking about the Hungarian Parliament violating fundamental European principles , I cannot help but feel that I do not share the principles to which you refer .
following the Paris Declaration on 13 July 2008 , which created a new Union for the Mediterranean ( UfM ) , the previous Barcelona Process should have acknowledged a new impetus , as expressed in the Declaration : &apos; a renewal of efforts to transform the Mediterranean region into a space of peace , democracy , cooperation and prosperity &apos; .
the Austrian initiative must be rejected on the grounds that it authorises attacks on the right of asylum in Europe and anticipates the way in which , in the context of drafting European legislation , the Member States intend to abandon any consideration of the right of asylum and of the Geneva Convention .
indeed , on other occasions I have benefited from the expertise of some of Members of this Parliament regarding environmental questions in developing countries .
. I have on many occasions had the opportunity to speak in considerable detail on the institutional model for Europe that I consider most appropriate .
it is not a burden that is easily carried so we require a review every 12 months .
once the report was assigned to the REX Committee we contacted the people of Ceuta in order to discover the social and economic reality there so that this report would be as objective as possible .
openness and transparency also mean that every citizen of the Union should be able to read about the activities of the EP in his or her own language .
Mr President , I would like to ask Mr Gualtieri whether it has occurred to him that intergovernmental cooperation would be a much better path for the peoples of Europe and the unemployed in Europe than the European superstate which he seems to be advocating ?

their creation depends , moreover , on some unacceptable certificate of European ‘ right-thinking ’ bestowed by this institution , based on the programmes that they are required to submit to its authorities .
it seems that all is now set for the final assault .
the first point is simplification - less bureaucracy - and we stated that when we started the Seventh Framework Programme .

it will not be possible to achieve the Kyoto objectives without new resources for research into new energy technologies .

Mr President , at the moment , in the United States , in Virginia , the life of a young Italo-American who has been condemned to die but continues to declare his innocence is just one of the many lives which must be saved .

the predictions and anxieties were shown to have been unjustified .
how will they be informed about the progress or otherwise of the strategy , and what is the mechanism for public supervision ?

we only need to look at the investment opportunities and possibly toward making the rules more precise , as well as investing in new projects to support rail transport so that it will become more profitable and better able to serve the citizens of Europe .
we would be interested to find out whether she would be prepared to share some of the information .
I would also like to thank my colleagues for their outstanding cooperation in bringing us to the point of tomorrow &apos;s vote ; shadows and staff have truly pulled out all the stops so that we could complete Parliament &apos;s first reading in the shortest possible time , so as to be in a position to seek a first-reading agreement and thus to avoid any further delays .
I call on the Commission to reexamine the Mochovce project in terms of its danger to Europe and , if need be , to take the necessary steps to halt it .
in writing . - ( DE ) I shall be voting for Alessandro Foglietta &apos;s report concerning the White Paper on a strategy for Europe on nutrition- , overweight- and obesity-related health issues .
Europe 2020 is not about one level acting at the expense of the other .

can the President-in-Office comment on whether the Council will deliberate whether we can have our meetings solely in Brussels and not have to come to Strasbourg ?
Free movement of the labour force must be guaranteed .

may I also point out that the English text of Amendment 31 should be put to the vote , as I have noticed that a very important word has been omitted from the French and German texts .
in the same way as an agreement between trades unions and business , for example , may be binding on the parties involved , the open method of coordination may be used to draw up this kind of contract , but it is subject to Community regulations and can never replace them , and the European Union as a community based on law requires the adoption of legal texts .
Mr President , I have enormous respect for Bernd Posselt .
this means that Colonel Gaddafi is completely isolated .
this may be irrelevant , but I see that here among the Parliament members there are many women .
Mr President , as a European citizen I am obviously delighted by the establishment of a new financing instrument for cultural cooperation in Europe .
I met the Mayor of Belgrade and visited with him a Belgrade school being renovated under the European Commission &apos;s Schools for Democracy programme .
this all shows an engagement with Europe that we might not have had before .
in addition , I am pleased that , in this report , Parliament calls on the Commission to consider proposing that planting rights in the wine sector be maintained beyond 2015 .
the European Commission has developed and implemented a series of measures specifically designed to help such enterprises .
the Cercas report seizes this opportunity and proposes the gradual abolition of any possible derogation from the maximum legal limit on the number of hours worked .
the monitoring mechanism has used this to reduce tensions between the parties following the incidents in the Black Sea and to resolve an incident at South Ossetia &apos;s administrative border in which 21 Georgian citizens were detained and then later released .
I would like to point out that the Czech Republic in particular , with an average farm size of 85 ha ( the European average is about 15 ha ) has the largest agricultural undertakings in the EU , so they would pay a heavy price for the ceiling on direct payments .
one of the most recent outbursts of anti-Christian violence was in Alexandria at New Year when 25 people were killed and 80 injured in the bombing of a church .
Zimbabwe is violating the standards stipulated by the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for selling rough diamonds .
Heads of State or Government are now approaching Copenhagen .
we wish the Irish Presidency every success in achieving that for us .
I voted against this resolution , which sets a dangerous precedent in that the points of view expressed do not abide by the principle of subsidiarity and are a form of intervention in the sovereign actions of the parliament of a Member State , at a time when the law in question has not even entered into force .
( the President cut off the speaker )
their deaths and the violence inflicted on their close relatives by a squad of heavily-armed killers demonstrate the ruthless inhumanity of those responsible for organizing terrorism in Colombia today .

a simpler distinction between waste and used equipment therefore needs to be introduced with the help of the directive .
a positive vote will be a vote for ending cruelty .
this made it possible to adopt the report as a whole , despite the very large number of amendments .
we also have to look at how we develop legislation which can be properly implemented .
it has direct implications for the health of humans , plants and animals .
on those lines , the proposals made by the Socialist Group head in that direction .
in the same way we succeeded in fulfilling a task which many thought us incapable of ; the issue of institutional reform .
indeed , the rejection of the European Constitutional Treaty by two Member States in fact nullifies the proposal submitted for ratification by the Member States in 2005 .
the first step towards the creation of the Convention on the Future of Europe was taken when the French President agreed that there was a need to think about introducing a new method of reforming the EU , and the next was the Laeken decision and the work with which we are all familiar .
. I congratulate our rapporteur on his initiative .
the rapporteur adheres closely to this philosophy , following the Lisbon strategy , in particular the objective of creating , within a decade , the world &apos; s most dynamic and competitive economy .
I would like to stress that I intend to reject the amendments tabled by the ARE Group , the GUE Group and the Liberal Group , purely and simply because these amendments effectively resuscitate ideas from the first consultation in September , which I rejected for the reasons I have already stated and which I have no alternative but to reject again now .
it is not I who will be in the chair this time .
in Seville I made the acquaintance of the work of the &apos; Tres Culturas &apos; organisation , and I say to you - not only to honour my Spanish predecessor , Mr Josep Borrell - that we must actively support every example of coexistence in Europe of Christians , Muslims and Jews - and also , of course , of those who do not belong to any of these religions .
does the fact that something can be done make it right , or is there an ethical rule to say whether it is right ? &apos;
under these circumstances the pressure to improve the human rights situation in China is dwindling .
we need to be able to tell the public , as consumers , much more forcefully why it is that meat from vaccinated animals is safe to eat .
the report under discussion tackles very important issues and makes some arguments that are correct : for example , the closing of tax havens , the cancelling of the foreign debt of certain countries , the need for increased efforts in terms of Official Development Assistance , and a tax on financial transactions .
I am therefore opposed to the amendment to Article 7 ( 3 ) , which deals with the radio frequency needs of specific EU policies and which proposes using civil frequencies for military purposes .

five hundred mammal and bird species and more than 110 species of orchids can now be traded freely in Europe .
it is a question of making , for example , the railways as competitive as road transport .
Firstly , the collection of epidemiological data and compiling a catalogue of rare diseases , as this is necessary in order to have a clear picture of the field of these diseases in the European Union .
the report on an Industrial Policy for the Globalised Era lists precisely these objectives : industrial innovation and simplification of existing legislation with the interests of citizens at its heart , and the role of small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) - the beating heart of the European economy .
we have chosen to vote against both of these reports as we consider that the total payment appropriations should be below 1 % of the total GNI of the EU Member States in accordance with the proposal from the G6 countries .
it will make it possible to exclude firms that have engaged in fraud from contracts with the Commission .
if you or your colleagues and the College , find in TNT &apos;s favour in this case , I believe , Mr Špidla , that you will lose all credibility , in this and in other cases , and that it will take more than a recommendation from the Commission on the best information and administrative cooperation between Member States to truly guarantee the dignity of workers in the European Union .
I just want to agree with what my colleague Mr Fitzsimons says .
and secondly , as has been said particularly by Commissioner Kinnock , a peaceful transition of Hong Kong is in the interests of all concerned .
truth and memory have an important role in connection with this .
the proposed opening of the economies of the ACP countries – most of which are least-developed countries – is a major concern .
for Amendment No 3 , the reference to the first sentence of article 17 of the fourth directive on company law is acceptable , on condition that the rest of the definition remains unchanged .
let me repeat , we take this issue seriously , and I am delighted that we are working with a presidency which has taken it so seriously and has pursued it with considerable skill and very good political judgment .
you will understand , of course , that I cannot speak on behalf of the Council and I would urge Parliament to engage constructively with the Council on this subject in the future .
as you know , the Council has already banned - in 1990 - the placing on the market and the use of BST on dairy cows under Council Decision 90 / 218 / EEC .
I hope that the various political groups will also stop their political games and withdraw the resolutions in question .
in the first paragraph of last year ’ s resolution about the annual report 2003 , Parliament asked the ECB to set up a working party to investigate the need for introducing the EUR 1 note .
in addition , all types of product and service must be covered by clearing agencies of this kind .
Examples of these are the agreement on security in the Middle East on the principles of the end to violence , recognition of states and recognition of the Palestinian Authority as a legitimate participant along with support for the Mitchell and Tenet plans . the improvement in the situation in the Balkans was also noted .
while we must always be concerned to make our policies more efficient , we shall have to guard against any possible attempt at renationalising the CAP and regional policies .
I have in mind its appeal to religious authorities to play an active part in preventive programmes , particularly where the distribution of condoms is concerned
we therefore need to initiate a serious debate on the European Neighbourhood Policy which will focus on initiatives to support the path to democracy , especially in the countries of the southern shores of the Mediterranean .
I also draw attention to the importance of the education of pedestrians and cyclists .
I would also like to mention that at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council this week , this Monday , we approved the 18-month programme of the three upcoming Presidencies .
however , let me be clear . it is not for us to dictate outcomes or impose solutions .
so , for colleagues who doubt that codecision has been honoured , not only in the spirit of the law but in the letter of the law , let me assure them there were no surprises in what came back from the summit because all the issues and the parameters had been thoroughly thrashed out in five or six trialogues in advance of the summit .
many would say , and indeed some of us today have said , that there is not - that everyone here must agree on such questions , which are technical and economic .
so let us be open to scrutiny , for such openness can only increase our own credibility .
– Mr President , the Commissioner has already mentioned one of the problems .
most of the 147 signatures come from this group , and I would like to thank the former Belgian Prime Minister , Mr Dehaene , for informing the Members of this group in unequivocal terms that while this solution may be acceptable from a legal perspective , politically it is completely unacceptable .
Mr President , despite all the fine words , I cannot shake off the impression that the Laeken Summit is actually intended to clean up the very soiled image of the Belgian Presidency , an attempt to brush successive howlers by the Verhofstadt-Michel government team under the carpet .
for example , I wonder who will from now on bring the required pressure to bear on researchers and on the world of science , which still has to provide many answers to our queries .
I am therefore delighted that our rapporteur was prepared to approve a few important additions in this respect .
( PT ) Mr President , Mrs Wallström , ladies and gentlemen , the transparency principle is a basic principle of the European Union .
Agrarian reform has to be implemented , and economic and social justice must be established .
we hear talk of a return to the 1964 constitution .
thank you very much .
