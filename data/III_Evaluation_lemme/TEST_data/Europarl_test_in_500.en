This is why the regulation stipulates that the European Commission must analyse different means of regulating the market.
Member States received the Commission’s working document before my press conference on 23 February.
I support the recognition given to small and medium-sized enterprises in the construction sector, just as I support the particular attention paid to the need to recycle construction products, which is an issue of the utmost importance in the fight against climate change.
They are working shoulder to shoulder with us and playing a significant role, and this is being demonstrated in popular referendums.
This might well be conceivable but this is not what is at issue here. What we are ultimately talking about here is mainly money and anything related to it.
UN Aids again reminded us very recently of the sad reality that the world has never before had so many people who are carriers of HIV.
All this, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, will take place within a rigorous budgetary framework set until 2006, in which the financial resources of the European Union will never exceed a ceiling of 1.27 % of its GNP. The financial resources available for the common agricultural policy are therefore limited.
This inconsistency is heightened by the lack of any social initiatives at European level.
Perhaps Saakashvili also organised the deportation of Georgians from Moscow two years ago and the summoning of the Pskov paratrooper division to the area on the eve of the battles?
We therefore also have the right to say that anyone who wants to use the dead of the Second World War to bargain for more votes in the Council of Ministers misunderstands what European politics is all about and should be rejected out of hand.
In its latest announcement, the Commission emphasised that accession has brought economic perspective and resources for new Member States, and a new momentum and a larger market for old Member States.
I would like to summarise this briefly in one conclusion, namely that, whatever Member States or we think of the harmonisations of penalty provisions or however this takes place, we should be able to decide on the matter in question for ourselves.
Because of the dual problem of competitiveness and safety, it is thus important, first of all, to suspend the authorization to import genetically modified products into the European Union, because the national authorities of Member States are not all in agreement and a large majority is even opposed to this.
What we need now is a sensible way out of this situation.
(PL) Mr President, I congratulate Mr Savary on his treatment of the subject.
This is not just another department, one of the many centres of European bureaucracy: it is an institution which, in carrying out its recording and statistical work, is, in actual fact, the guarantor of the Stability Pact, verifying the implementation of the Maastricht criteria.
We cannot carry on saying 'yes' to everything that is tabled in order to demonstrate our justified concern, uncertainty and willingness to act with regard to the issue of climate change.
Mrs Morgantini has really covered this subject extensively.
It engages in close cooperation with its neighbours and we honestly welcome the constructive role it is playing in stabilising the region and promoting good neighbourhood relations, particularly as the country holding the Presidency of the South-East Europe Cooperation Process.
Many issues surrounding the flow of information are raised by the Eurostat affair.
There is a need for increased cooperation between those ministers, and the officials looking after external borders need to be fully aware that they are doing not only a national job, but also a European one, and that they share responsibility for what happens throughout the Schengen area.
We have in practice thus discussed the issue simultaneously with the Commission and the Council, as well as amongst ourselves and with many other parties, and now we have achieved this result, which is nothing to be ashamed about.
We also agreed to some extent that the Commission - to turn to the European level - uses soft law in individual cases as a means of circumventing the opportunities for the participation of the legislator as provided for by law.
The value of an international agreement, which would for the first time establish rules for the control of the trade, should not be underestimated.
The rapporteur rightly starts from the principle of voluntary mobility of people going to work in another Member State or in Switzerland.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is the primary responsibility of us, the members of the European Parliament, the institution with democratic credentials , to impart material content to the Community action plan which expires in December 2004, because the institutional to date is insignificant.
Once it costs EUR 20 to 30 a tonne, the picture will be quite different and will naturally have effects on energy policy.
It was very gratifying to see the majority of new Member States siding so powerfully with those values that form the basis of our European cooperation, and correspondingly sad to see long-standing Member States react to those countries' stance with threats and blackmail.

Cyprus, for example, invests half a billion euro on LNG, and I regret that the Union assists with only EUR 10 million.

I can only reaffirm that, at local level, the professional workers, employees, citizens and local authorities, if they failed to grasp the scientific justification of this text, would find it hard to understand that, after all their efforts (sanitary measures, tests, slaughtering herds), the European Union is asking them to make a further effort which goes beyond the financial limits that they are able to cope with.
In the end, however, it must understand that private investors do not have the welfare of the country and its people in mind, but ultimately only their profits and returns on their investment.
Amendments Nos 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 will be rejected as they are either incompatible with certain amendments we are ready to accept or they introduce derogation clauses which endanger the directive's aims and objectives.
We must point out that the Algerian State has suspended the publication of a number of newspapers for several weeks, on the pretext of commercial disputes.
I find this fundamentally questionable. For one thing, Article 87 of the EC Treaty quite clearly states that subsidies in this form are not permissible.
Now, after years of confusing and misleading consumers, they have to rectify that mistake. They accept that it is necessary to distinguish between the generic designation of honey and the specific designation of honey derivatives.
We are not going to support Mr Cox's report.
Although Facebook, the Internet and Twitter are the modern means of driving a revolution, they do not replace the democratic structures and the rule of law that need to be in place behind the scenes for a revolution to be able to make the transition into a democratic system.
One final example: companies whose management consists of at least 30% women achieve better business success.
We must, therefore, ensure that we have all the tools we need to fight terrorism tooth and nail, but that does not mean we can be careless with the reputations, the confidentiality or the privacy of our citizens, and I urge the Commission to take that into account.
I believe that no serious difficulties should arise and that there should be substantial respect for the agreement in that the desired objective has been achieved, and that the clause should not be implemented because it does not help us at the moment.

It is very important that I make this clear to you, so that all of us are aware of our responsibilities.
We look forward with eager anticipation to what the Commission has to say to us, hoping that what is done about this important issue will be faithful to the spirit of the Constitution and will make it manifest.
Since there is not or not yet a chapter on energy in the Treaty, even though energy policy is in the common interest of us all, the legal basis must be the one that relates most closely to the subject concerned.
Subject: Dioxin rules threaten fish in the Baltic A Commission proposal on the limit values for dioxin in fish could be a death blow to the Swedish fishing industry.
If I am not mistaken, this question comes from Mr Bertens. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be almost a platitude to reiterate how deeply all of us in the Council cherish the freedom of the press and how determined we all are that the freedom of journalists should be assured, even in crisis areas.
Madam President, 2001 is the year of public debate.

The text on which the rapporteur and the French Presidency have agreed respects these requirements, and I am pleased about this.
An excellent example!
We are expressing here the same reservations that we have about other agreements, their scope and the possible consequences that they may have.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure and pride that we are discussing this strategy here this evening: pleasure because Mrs Járóka has done an excellent job, for which I thank her, and pride because it is an initiative that we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have very much wanted.
I believe that in these circumstances, with this kind of pressure, it is impossible for us to vote.
the report (A5-0271/2000) by Mr Moreira Da Silva, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the European Commission Green Paper on greenhouse gas emissions trading within the European Union [COM(2000) 87 - C5-0193/2000 - 2000/2104(COS)];

My second point is that the Baltic is a sensitive maritime area.
Past experience has shown us that there is no time to spare.
That is what is officially recorded; the true figure may well be many times higher.
The next target area after the conclusion of Agenda 2000 - and another reason why it is so important now to bring Agenda 2000 to a positive conclusion - will be the EU's institutional reform.
It is my country which, if it does not relent in this case, should hang its head in shame.
We are also deceiving ourselves if, like one of the previous speakers, we believe that research is being carried out into the very neurotoxic substances that feature in the alarming brain study to which she refers.
It is now our duty to rediscover this cultural unity which must consolidate the necessary and, I would argue, right and proper, irreversible decision to enlarge the Union.
For this reason, I urge the European Union to adopt a coherent strategy and develop relations with neighbouring countries, particularly with China and India, with a view to promoting transparent elections in Burma.
And nature, as we learned at school, abhors a vacuum.
E-health was also dealt with in a very sensible fashion in that it is offered in order to provide flexibility, and Member States can pick it up if they wish and when they wish.
This would cause a disparity in rules that would increase confusion rather than make the provision more effective.
The Palestinian Authority will be unable to resolve the security problem on its own.
The Commission would be grateful if Parliament could adopt a positive opinion during the present part-session, since it is eager to embark on the implementation stage immediately after the new regulation enters into force, in order to provide the special coordinator of the Stability Pact with the timely support that will allow him to fulfil his mandate in 2004.
We have to accept that Parliament has a role in this and we have to say that we want to see the EDF budgetized.

The present sugar regime has been in force, unchanged, for 40 years.
I thank them and their entire team for their excellent cooperation, despite some internal political difficulties.
But anyone who denies the existence of this political agenda - which subsumes the single currency - in my view is either deluded or dishonest, because it is a very real agenda.
Madam President, I should like to add my congratulations and conclude with a warning.
To this desire to have people forget what we are, on the model of the Communists who wished to make a blank sheet of the past, can be added a commercial dimension whereby the EU’s communication strategy inevitably becomes subject to market principles, to the point at which there is talk of promoting a ‘Europe’ brand in the same way as an everyday packet of washing powder.
This is the challenge ahead of us, and our answer, despite everything, should be that we are still persevering in our efforts and that we must take heart.
MRI scanning is an essential medical procedure for certain patients, and in my view it should have been made the subject of a derogation, instead of postponing application of the entire directive for four years!

As Mrs Hautala is aware, extending sanctions requires unanimity in the Council.

All the food production sectors, like the consumers themselves, have understood the full import of this drive to clarify matters.

The fundamental change ushered in by the Treaty of Lisbon applies precisely to this long-term programming of the budget, which must be compiled afresh by the Council after approval by the European Parliament.
The report he submitted to us today is certainly not the report he wanted; it is certainly not the report that I wanted and that the Group of the European Radical Alliance wanted; it is a report which has encountered many problems before reaching today's sitting, and may I say that I detected a certain irony in the speech made by our British friend, Mr Titley.
On 14 and 15 October, the Justice and Home Affairs Council stated that heavy goods vehicles carrying valuable commercial goods are increasingly becoming an easy target for criminal organisations.

I believe that sanctions are essential, but that they are most useful if they do not have to be enforced.
This was not the position of Parliament.
In fact, back at first reading, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market argued strongly in favour of rectifying this deplorable state of affairs and helping to reinstate the citizens' right to see their European laws upheld, and to avoid the EU falling into disrepute as a Community of law, on account of delays.
This approach may result either in the duplication of some objectives, for example environmental protection, education and culture, or their omission in both areas.

It covers the low pathogenic version as well as the N2 pathogenic strain, but also introduces effective eradication measures, including vaccination, taking into account scientific evidence and experiences in Europe in recent years – I could mention the Netherlands case two years ago – and elsewhere in the world, and of course the need to avoid the large-scale slaughter and destruction of animals.

Mr President, if anyone ever doubted that a small Member State of the European Union could perform a world-class act then the Irish presidency has dispelled that doubt.
How can we take our presumptions about equality and fairness and justice, born of a deep Christian or humanist tradition, in Europe, and expect other cultures with other religions or beliefs, or with a lack of beliefs, to understand exactly what we are saying, without appearing to be ramming neo-colonial ideas down their throats?

I would like to thank all my colleagues for their support.

on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, the EU published the new draft Treaty at 5 p.m. on Friday - thus satisfying itself that the media would not write about it at the weekend.

This is why we are being consulted again today.
The conclusions from the Seville European Council outline the measures which are to be taken with a view to combating the problem of illegal immigration effectively at EU level; and here we are talking about both prevention and restriction of immigration.
That is why it is a great project, and I would thank all those who have spoken in favour of it.

I urge you to help in this case.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the composition of seats at Parliament contains some obvious contradictions, reinforced by the letter sent by the rapporteurs yesterday, as if to justify their position regarding such politically delicate questions, and it distorts the legal concept of citizenship as it has always been codified.
The message has been extremely muddled and fraught with consequences, including for Spanish producers, but not just for them, since others have been affected too. This point was made several times just now.
The decision not to quote statistics in relation to accession speaks of a healthy sense of realism, given that this is determined by the accession criteria.

It is true that if we had a magic wand we could have acted on the very night of the elections.
Our Italian colleagues used the rate advantage they gained from their accession to the euro area to consolidate.
However, alongside the essential quantitative increase in mobility, we also need to provide a counterbalance in terms of quality in the consensual determination of rules and behaviour able to guarantee the educational efficacy of placements and exchanges.

Mr President, the proposal for a Council recommendation with regard to the prevention of tobacco smoking only partly corresponds with my views.
I firmly believe that we need to focus the review debate early in the process to ensure a high-quality outcome.
I also agree with the statement that there is a need for common definitions by European Union Member States of certain questions relating to security and defence, such as threats, interests and strategic objectives.
Moreover, six EU Member States have been able to maintain a primary surplus of over 4% for at least four years, so it is not impossible.
The importance of national cultures is being emphasised with globalisation.
It is this positive policy which has allowed us to make good progress in this area so far and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament for its support.
The socialists are the leading accomplices of this system: in France, for instance, they only grant FRF 100 per farm per year for conversion to organic farming.
In this regard I agree with Mr Guardans: it is not proper, it is not morally correct, to use this Parliament to blacken the name of a Community, of a legitimately elected Parliament and of a government supported by the citizens.
By the deadline it is setting, there will not be any cages on the market in the form specified for commercial use.
I should also highlight the constructive role played in Bonn by the developing countries, G4-77/China, under the chairmanship of Iran, sharing EU positions on many points.
We must support the Commission in its demand for respect for the WTO rules.
I believe that view to be defeatist and wrong, not to say reactionary, and I am therefore gratified to note that the great majority of the comments on the White Paper reflect a similar view.
Its inability to do so is one example of its failure.
One of the speakers even said that you aspire to teach them.
Also, when the Council adds provisions to Commission proposals in common position, they should be properly costed too?
I take note of the very interesting idea of establishing a European Year against violence towards women and children.

However, as Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to insist on behalf, I believe, of all fellow Members that Parliament is treated as an equal, including in regard to the forwarding of documents and non-papers on everything that will have to be discussed and negotiated jointly in the coming months, rather than as a second-rate institution.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the debate on the imposition of a tax on international financial transactions may not be new, but it is extremely topical today, because the basic lesson from the crisis in the global economy, especially for the euro area, which has been subject to systematic attacks by speculators recently, is that the previous unaccountability of the financial markets and the lack of fundamental financial regulation and governance is having immediate and visible repercussions on the real economy, on the viability of public economies, and on social stability.
On the whole, the proposals drawn up by the European Parliament in the van Velzen report seem inspired by good sense, notably in the area of training and flexibility of working hours, as well as in the lightening of the burden on the low paid.

Such is our hypocritical and cynical European democracy.
(SL) I am one of the few who recently had an opportunity to visit Tibet.
In Romania, I support the campaign run by the UN Population Fund and the UN Information Centre, entitled 'Women in Shadows'.

I will return to them in due course.
My final point, ladies and gentlemen, is a very fundamental one.
Our education systems are different.
In the interests of securing cross-border mobility, the recognition of diplomas in this field must also be promoted.
The first is that we are in the European Parliament and, last Friday, we held a debate without the Commission and without the report from the experts.

Of course, there will always be exceptions, which we saw as recently as at the time of the EU Council rulings. There will always be new cases of individual Member States deciding that they do not wish to participate, or at least not initially, in particular policies, whilst others lead the way, although within the scope of the treaty.
In today's speech by the American Government, it was no longer possible to dissociate concerns about oil from legitimate concern over weapons of mass destruction, equally legitimate concerns over human rights and Saddam Hussein himself as a person, whom Mr Bush professes to hate.
I do not think anything the Irish presidency did halted efforts to make the European Union a military superpower or to stop the widening of the gap between rich and poor, which is the likely outcome of EMU.
Nevertheless, I have a number of serious objections to the report as a whole. First of all, there is the fact that it places responsibility for human rights in the Union entirely in the hands of the national governments.
Yet, every day, I receive messages from concerned citizens and companies and, still, there is a general consensus among the groups in the European Parliament that this draft agreement undermines the fundamental rights of our citizens and passengers from third countries.

I thank Parliament for what amounts to a powerful affirmation of the Commission's policy on this particularly difficult issue, as expounded by myself and others - and expressed, if I might say so, with some considerable eloquence and passion.

It is our turn to put our words into action.

To conclude briefly - the EIB is also having problems in the area of development.
It is an important report.
The various questions raised, which are all on the subject of the role of the regional bodies in the process of preparing for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004, are concerned with two types of problem. On the one hand, there are the detailed rules for implementing the preparatory phase which precedes the next Intergovernmental Conference, and on the other there is the issue of the role of the regional bodies in the construction of the Union.

When I asked Mr Caveri to include these facts, he referred me to his Amendment No 17, which simply says, 'shall ensure that it is done correctly', and, at the same time, explained that there was nothing he could do if the engines of HGVs were tweaked - and, if he is accusing Italian hauliers of doing that, now really has to be the time for him to explain himself.

A great deal will depend on the success of this EULEX mission, because Kosovo was a protectorate for ten years prior to its independence.
I am sure that the events leading up to the investiture of Vojislav Kostunica will still be fresh in your minds. This investiture and these events have seen a completely new political order being installed in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, opening the way to the democratisation of the country and, let us hope, a more widespread reconciliation in the Balkans.

It seems to me very clear, for example, that if the rules for entering chat rooms were to be tightened up, by not allowing the use of, for example, Hotmail - I confess I do not know very much about it but it is very easily used - and insisting instead on some sort of traceable e-mail, then the people who do these sorts of things, which they could not do in the open, would be more easily traced.

The purpose of this proposal is quite simply, on the one hand, to show that racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism threaten democratic society and the economic and social cohesion of the Union and, on the other hand, to raise public awareness and understanding of how the institutions of the Union are working to combat xenophobia.
Why do we need these taxes?
Will you be making a strong case for Community interests?

This solution is now within reach with the introduction of a European Health Insurance Card.
